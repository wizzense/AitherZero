# AitherZero AI Workforce

Welcome to the AitherZero AI workforce! This directory contains custom GitHub Copilot agents with diverse personas designed to support various aspects of the AitherZero infrastructure automation platform.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Using Agent Routing

The repository includes an **automatic agent routing system** that suggests the best agents for your PR based on the files you change and keywords in your description. 

**To use it:**
1. Open a PR - agents are automatically suggested in a comment
2. Request specific agents: `@maya, please review` or `/infrastructure`
3. See [Agent Routing Guide](../AGENT-ROUTING-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions

- **File Pattern Matching**: Agents are suggested based on which files you modify
- **Keyword Detection**: PR titles/descriptions trigger relevant agent suggestions
- **Label-Based Routing**: GitHub labels map to agent expertise areas
- **Manual Invocation**: Use `@agent-name` or `/command` in comments
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Pre-configured multi-agent workflows

**Workflow Integration:**
- [`.github/workflows/copilot-agent-router.yml`](../workflows/copilot-agent-router.yml) - Automation workflow
- Automatically posts agent suggestions on PR open/update
- Handles agent command parsing and acknowledgment

For complete details, see the [Agent Routing Guide](../AGENT-ROUTING-GUIDE.md).
