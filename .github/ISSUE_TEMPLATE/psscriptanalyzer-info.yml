        ## üí° Improvement Guidelines
        
        **For Information-level findings:**
        1. **Optional Improvements** - These are suggestions, not requirements
        2. **Batch Processing** - Group similar improvements together
        3. **Timing Flexibility** - Address when convenient or during refactoring
        4. **Automation Opportunities** - Many can be automated
        
        **Decision Framework:**
        - **High Value, Low Effort** ‚Üí Address soon
        - **High Value, High Effort** ‚Üí Plan for future iteration
        - **Low Value, Low Effort** ‚Üí Consider for automation
        - **Low Value, High Effort** ‚Üí May not be worth addressing
        
        **Automated Processing:**
        - Some informational findings can be automatically addressed
        - This issue may be auto-closed during bulk improvements
        - Status tracked in .bugz files for reporting
        
        **Benefits Tracking:**
        - Code quality score improvements
        - Enhanced maintainability metrics
        - Better development experience
