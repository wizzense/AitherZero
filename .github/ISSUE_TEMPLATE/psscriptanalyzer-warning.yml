        ## üîß Resolution Guidelines
        
        **For Warning-level findings:**
        1. **Regular Review** - Address during routine code maintenance
        2. **Batch Processing** - Can be grouped with similar warnings
        3. **Automation Candidate** - Consider for automated remediation
        4. **Documentation** - Update .bugz file with resolution or justification
        
        **Framework Considerations:**
        - Some warnings may be acceptable for framework-specific needs
        - Business justification required for permanent ignores
        - Cross-platform compatibility should be maintained
        
        **Automated Processing:**
        - Eligible warnings may be automatically fixed in weekly remediation
        - This issue will be updated based on .bugz file changes
        - Auto-closure when finding is resolved or justified
