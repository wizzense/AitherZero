# Multi-Agent Orchestration System

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive multi-agent orchestration system that enables Gemini and Copilot to work together in automated feedback loops for issue triage, PR reviews, and automated fixes.

## Goals

1. **Automated PR Review Cycles**: Gemini reviews PRs → Copilot fixes issues → Repeat until no feedback
2. **Issue Triage & Management**: Automated issue classification, assignment, and prioritization
3. **Intelligent Orchestration**: Smart delays, iteration limits, and recursion protection
4. **Maintainable Architecture**: Clean, modular workflows that are easy to understand and extend

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Multi-Agent Coordinator Workflow
Central orchestrator managing agent interactions:
- State management (iteration tracking, feedback history)
- Agent routing logic (when to invoke Gemini vs Copilot)
- Recursion protection (max iterations: 5-10)
- Rate limiting (delays between iterations: 2-5 minutes)

#### 2. Gemini Review Agent
- Automated PR reviews on synchronize events
- Issue triage and classification
- Generates actionable feedback for Copilot
- Outputs structured review data (JSON format)

#### 3. Copilot Fix Agent
- Consumes Gemini feedback
- Applies automated fixes
- Commits changes with descriptive messages
- Signals completion back to coordinator

#### 4. Convergence Detection
Determines when the feedback loop should terminate:
- No new feedback from Gemini
- All issues resolved
- Max iterations reached
- Timeout threshold exceeded

### Workflow Flow

```
PR Created/Updated
        ↓
[Multi-Agent Coordinator]
        ↓
[Gemini Review] → Generates feedback
        ↓
  Has feedback? ─No→ [Complete ✓]
        ↓ Yes
[Copilot Fix] → Applies changes
        ↓
  Iteration < Max? ─No→ [Max iterations reached ⚠️]
        ↓ Yes
[Wait 2-5 min] (Rate limiting)
        ↓
[Trigger new review cycle]
        ↓
     (Loop back)
```

## Technical Requirements

### Configuration

**Repository Secrets**:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Gemini API authentication
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Enhanced permissions for PR operations

**Repository Variables**:
- `GEMINI_MODEL` - Model to use (e.g., "gemini-1.5-pro")
- `MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` - Maximum feedback cycles (default: 5)
- `REVIEW_DELAY_MINUTES` - Delay between iterations (default: 3)
- `ENABLE_AUTO_FIX` - Feature flag for automated fixes (default: true)

### Safety Features

1. **Iteration Limits**: Hard cap at 10 iterations, configurable default of 5
2. **Rate Limiting**: Minimum 2-minute delay between cycles
3. **Timeout Protection**: Maximum 30 minutes per cycle
4. **Emergency Stop**: Manual workflow cancellation
5. **Recursion Detection**: Identify and prevent infinite loops
6. **Fork Protection**: Never run on fork PRs
7. **Branch Protection**: Skip for protected branches unless explicitly enabled

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation if agents fail
- Detailed error logging and notifications
- Automatic issue creation for failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
- Fallback to manual review on errors

## Success Metrics

- **Automation Rate**: % of PRs fully reviewed and fixed automatically
- **Convergence Time**: Average time to reach "no feedback" state
- **Iteration Count**: Average iterations needed per PR
- **Success Rate**: % of cycles that complete without errors
- **Manual Intervention**: % of PRs requiring manual fixes
- **Time Savings**: Reduction in manual review time

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Infinite loops | High | Medium | Iteration limits, timeouts, circuit breakers |
| API quota exhaustion | High | Medium | Rate limiting, quota monitoring |
| Incorrect automated fixes | High | Low | Review before merge, rollback capability |
| Complex feedback not understood | Medium | Medium | Structured output format, fallback to manual |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Async processing, monitoring |

## Dependencies

- Gemini API access with adequate quota
- GitHub API enhanced permissions
- Stable workflow infrastructure
- Monitoring and alerting system

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-agent collaboration beyond Gemini/Copilot
- Learning from feedback patterns
- Predictive issue triaging
- Automatic documentation generation
- Cross-repository learning
