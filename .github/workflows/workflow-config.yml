# Optimization strategies implemented:
# 1. Caching Strategy:
#    - PowerShell modules cached with versioned keys
#    - Git metadata cached for faster operations
#    - Audit state cached to avoid redundant analysis
#    - Dependencies cached with composite keys
#
# 2. Artifact Management:
#    - Reduced retention days for CI artifacts (14 days)
#    - Longer retention for reports (90 days)
#    - Added if-no-files-found handling
#    - Consolidated artifact uploads
#
# 3. Performance Optimizations:
#    - Parallel execution limits optimized for GitHub Actions
#    - Reduced timeouts for faster feedback
#    - Fail-fast strategies for CI
#    - Conditional job execution based on changes
#
# 4. Error Handling:
#    - Timeout limits on all long-running steps
#    - Proper error propagation
#    - Graceful degradation for non-critical operations
#    - Comprehensive logging and annotations
#
# 5. Dependency Optimization:
#    - Workflow triggers optimized to reduce redundant runs
#    - Artifact sharing between workflows
#    - Conditional execution based on file changes
#    - Shared caching strategies
