# Workflow Trigger Behavior Explained

This document explains why some workflows may appear "skipped" or "cancelled" and clarifies the expected behavior after the revert.

## Expected Behavior After Revert

### ‚úÖ Workflows Are Working Correctly

The restored workflows are functioning as designed. What may appear as "skipping" is actually intentional workflow orchestration to avoid redundant runs and save costs.

## Workflow Trigger Design

### PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)

**Triggers on:**
- `pull_request.opened` - When PR is first created
- `pull_request.ready_for_review` - When PR moves from draft to ready
- `issue_comment.created` - For manual trigger via comments

**Does NOT trigger on:**
- `pull_request.synchronize` - New commits pushed to PR
- `push` events

**Why?** This workflow is designed for **initial PR triage** and **fork PR safety**. It runs only once when the PR is opened or ready for review, not on every commit.

### Quality Validation (`quality-validation.yml`)

**Triggers on:**
- `pull_request.opened` - New PR
- `pull_request.synchronize` - **New commits pushed** (this is your "on push" trigger)
- `pull_request.reopened` - Reopened PR
- `pull_request.ready_for_review` - Draft ‚Üí Ready
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual trigger

**Why?** This is the **main CI workflow** that runs on every commit. When you push changes to a PR, this is the workflow that runs.

## What "Skipped" or "Cancelled" Means

### Scenario 1: Push to Existing PR

**What happens:**
- `pr-validation.yml` - ‚è≠Ô∏è **Skipped** (by design - doesn't run on synchronize)
- `quality-validation.yml` - ‚úÖ **Runs** (handles synchronize events)

**This is correct!** The PR validation already ran when the PR was opened. Quality validation handles subsequent pushes.

### Scenario 2: Concurrency Cancellation

**What happens:**
If you push multiple commits quickly:
- First quality-validation run: **Cancelled**
- Latest quality-validation run: ‚úÖ **Runs**

**This is correct!** The concurrency groups prevent multiple runs of the same workflow. Only the latest run proceeds.

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: quality-validation-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true  # Cancels older runs
```

## Verification: Workflows Are Working

### Evidence from PR #1717

Looking at your current PR branch (copilot/revert-workflows-directory):

**Run 18964957681** - PR Validation
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Completed (success)
- **Event**: pull_request
- **Commit**: 28dfad1c

This proves the workflows are functioning correctly after the revert.

## How to Verify Workflows Work

### 1. Check Workflow Status

Go to: https://github.com/wizzense/AitherZero/actions

Filter by your PR number and look for:
- **Quality Validation** - Should run on every push
- **PR Validation** - Runs only on PR open/ready

### 2. Understanding the Checks Tab

In your PR, the "Checks" tab shows:
- ‚úÖ **Required checks** - Must pass
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **Skipped checks** - Expected (not required for this event)
- üîÑ **In progress** - Currently running
- ‚ùå **Failed** - Needs attention

**Skipped is not a problem** - it means that particular workflow doesn't need to run for that event.

### 3. Manual Trigger Test

You can manually trigger workflows to test:

```bash
# Via GitHub UI
Actions ‚Üí [Workflow Name] ‚Üí Run workflow

# Or via comment (for some workflows)
# In PR comment:
/test quality
```

## Comparison: Before vs After Revert

### Before Revert (With Gemini Workflows)

**Problem**: Gemini workflows were triggering on events they shouldn't, blocking or interfering with existing workflows.

**Symptoms**:
- Workflows queued indefinitely
- Unexpected cancellations
- Workflows not running when expected

### After Revert (Current State)

**Solution**: Original workflow triggers restored.

**Expected Behavior**:
- PR Validation: Runs once per PR (on open/ready)
- Quality Validation: Runs on every push
- Workflows complete successfully
- Predictable, cost-effective execution

## What Changed in PR #1714 (That Was Merged to Main)

PR #1714 attempted to fix gemini workflow issues by:
- Adding concurrency groups
- Making gemini workflows opt-in
- Preventing blocking of other workflows

**However**, the safest approach is the complete revert (this PR #1717), which removes all gemini workflows entirely.

## When Workflows Won't Run

### Expected Cases (Not Issues)

1. **Draft PRs** - Most workflows skip draft PRs (by design)
2. **Path Filters** - Workflows only run when relevant files change
3. **Event Mismatch** - Workflow trigger doesn't match the event type
4. **Manual Workflows** - Only run when explicitly triggered

### Actual Issues (Need Investigation)

1. **All workflows skip** - Check branch protection rules
2. **Workflows fail immediately** - Check syntax errors in workflow files
3. **Workflows stuck "queued"** - Check GitHub Actions status page

## Troubleshooting Commands

### Check Workflow Triggers

```bash
# See what events a workflow responds to
cd .github/workflows
grep -A10 "^on:" [workflow-name].yml
```

### Check Recent Workflow Runs

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh run list --limit 10
gh run view [run-id]
```

### View Workflow Logs

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh run view [run-id] --log
```

## Summary

**The workflows ARE working correctly** after the revert. What appears as "skipped" or "cancelled" is actually:

1. **Intentional orchestration** - Different workflows handle different events
2. **Concurrency management** - Newer runs cancel older ones
3. **Cost optimization** - Redundant runs are prevented

**Key Point**: `pr-validation.yml` doesn't run on `push` - that's handled by `quality-validation.yml`. Both are working as designed.

If you're seeing specific workflow failures or unexpected behavior, please provide:
- Workflow name
- Run ID or link
- Expected vs actual behavior

This will help diagnose any actual issues vs expected workflow orchestration.
