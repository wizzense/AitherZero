# Recovery Summary: Gemini Workflows Revert

## What Happened

On October 30, 2025, a file upload (commit `710a2cb1`, PR #1713) added Gemini workflow files that broke existing workflows. This document summarizes the recovery and preventive measures implemented.

## Recovery Actions Completed

### 1. Workflows Directory Restored
- **Reverted to:** Commit `e4b8032d` (state before gemini workflows)
- **Removed:**
  - `gemini-assistant/` directory (2 files)
  - `gemini-dispatch/` directory (2 files)
  - `issue-triage/` directory (3 files)
  - `pr-review/` directory (2 files)
  - `AWESOME.md`
  - `CONFIGURATION.md`
  - **Total removed:** 11 gemini-related files

- **Restored:**
  - `auto-create-issues-from-failures.yml`
  - `docker-publish.yml.disabled`
  - Original `README.md` content

- **Result:** All 18 original workflow files restored to working state

## Preventive Measures Implemented

### Automated Checkpoint System

To prevent this from happening again and make recovery trivial, we've implemented an automated checkpoint system:

#### Features
- **Frequency:** Every 15 minutes
- **Branch Format:** `checkpoint/main/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- **Retention:** 7 days (automatic cleanup)
- **Manual Triggers:** Available via GitHub Actions UI

#### Why This Helps

1. **Automatic Backups:** No manual intervention needed
2. **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Find exact state before issues occurred
3. **Simple Recovery:** One git command to restore any directory
4. **Minimal Overhead:** Branches are lightweight references
5. **No Performance Impact:** Doesn't affect main branch or development

#### Quick Recovery Example

If this happens again, recovery is simple:

```bash
# List available checkpoints
git fetch origin
git branch -r | grep checkpoint/main/

# Restore workflows from before the issue
git checkout checkpoint/main/20251030-230000 -- .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Restore workflows from checkpoint"
git push origin HEAD
```

## Documentation Created

1. **`CHECKPOINT-SYSTEM.md`** (7.6 KB)
   - Complete guide to checkpoint system
   - Recovery instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Best practices
   - Troubleshooting

2. **`automated-checkpoint.yml`** (4.7 KB)
   - Automated checkpoint workflow
   - Runs every 15 minutes
   - Cleanup of old checkpoints
   - Manual trigger support

3. **Updated `README.md`**
   - Added checkpoint system overview
   - Quick recovery example
   - Link to full documentation

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Branch Protection Rules

Consider adding protection for checkpoint branches:

```yaml
# In repository settings
Branch name pattern: checkpoint/**
- Restrict who can push to matching branches
- Allow: GitHub Actions
```

### 2. CODEOWNERS File

Protect the checkpoint workflow itself:

```
# Add to .github/CODEOWNERS
.github/workflows/automated-checkpoint.yml @your-team
.github/workflows/CHECKPOINT-SYSTEM.md @your-team
```

### 3. Pre-Merge Checklist

Before merging PRs that modify `.github/workflows/`:
- [ ] Review all file changes carefully
- [ ] Create manual checkpoint before merge
- [ ] Test in feature branch first
- [ ] Verify no directories/subdirectories are unintentionally added

### 4. Workflow Protection

Enable workflow approval requirements:
- Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions
- Enable "Require approval for all outside collaborators"

## Testing the Checkpoint System

### Automatic Test
- The checkpoint workflow will run automatically within 15 minutes
- Check: Actions → Automated Repository Checkpoints
- Verify: Branch `checkpoint/main/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` is created

### Manual Test
1. Go to Actions → Automated Repository Checkpoints
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter reason: "Testing checkpoint system"
4. Click "Run workflow" button
5. Verify branch creation in repository branches

### Recovery Test
1. Find a recent checkpoint:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git branch -r | grep checkpoint/main/ | tail -1
   ```

2. Test restoring a single file:
   ```bash
   CHECKPOINT="checkpoint/main/20251031-HHMMSS"
   git checkout $CHECKPOINT -- .github/workflows/README.md
   git diff
   git checkout HEAD -- .github/workflows/README.md  # Undo test
   ```

## Checkpoint System Configuration

### Adjust Frequency

Edit `.github/workflows/automated-checkpoint.yml`:

```yaml
# Every 15 minutes (current)
- cron: '*/15 * * * *'

# Every 30 minutes
- cron: '*/30 * * * *'

# Every hour
- cron: '0 * * * *'

# Every 5 minutes (for critical periods)
- cron: '*/5 * * * *'
```

### Adjust Retention

Edit cleanup step in workflow:

```bash
# 7 days (current)
CUTOFF_DATE=$(date -u -d '7 days ago' +"%Y%m%d")

# 14 days
CUTOFF_DATE=$(date -u -d '14 days ago' +"%Y%m%d")

# 30 days
CUTOFF_DATE=$(date -u -d '30 days ago' +"%Y%m%d")
```

## Cost Analysis

- **GitHub Actions Minutes:** ~30 seconds per checkpoint
- **Monthly Usage:** ~720 checkpoints × 30 seconds = ~6 hours/month
- **Storage:** Minimal (branches are references, not file copies)
- **Impact:** Zero impact on repository performance

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:

1. **Notification System:** Alert on checkpoint creation failures
2. **Checkpoint Validation:** Verify checkpoint integrity after creation
3. **Multi-Branch Checkpoints:** Extend to protect other branches (develop, staging)
4. **Checkpoint Dashboard:** GitHub Pages site showing checkpoint history
5. **Automated Recovery:** Workflow to automatically detect and revert broken changes

## Summary

✅ **Workflows restored** to working state (18 files)  
✅ **Gemini files removed** (11 files)  
✅ **Checkpoint system implemented** (runs every 15 minutes)  
✅ **Documentation complete** (recovery guide, best practices)  
✅ **Future recovery is now trivial** (one git command)

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor first automatic checkpoint (within 15 minutes)
2. Test manual checkpoint creation
3. Add branch protection rules (optional)
4. Update CODEOWNERS file (optional)
