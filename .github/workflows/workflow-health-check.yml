            The automated workflow health monitor detected issues with the GitHub Actions workflows.

            **Action Required:**
            1. Review the workflow health check output in the Actions tab
            2. Run locally: \`pwsh ./.github/scripts/monitor-workflow-health.ps1\`
            3. Fix any reported issues before merging

            **Common Issues:**
            - Missing concurrency groups
            - workflow_run trigger name mismatches
            - YAML syntax errors
            - Circular dependencies

            See [github-actions-troubleshoot.md](.github/prompts/github-actions-troubleshoot.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps.`
