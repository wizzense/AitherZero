            const closeMessage = `## üßπ Automated Cleanup

This auto-created issue is being closed as part of a system-wide cleanup.

**Reason:** Migrating to improved intelligent issue creation system with:
- Better deduplication logic
- PR-based workflow for grouped fixes
- More detailed context (file, domain, branch info)
- Manual priority assignment with recommendations
- Prevention of duplicate issues across branches

If this issue represents a real problem that still exists, it will be recreated by the new system with more context and better grouping.

**Next Steps:**
1. New issues will be created with improved deduplication
2. Similar issues will be grouped in PRs
3. Manual priority assignment required (P1-P10)
4. Copilot will be assigned to PRs, not individual issues

          This workflow closes all existing auto-created issues as part of migrating to an improved issue creation system.

          ### Improvements in New System:
          - ‚úÖ Better deduplication by type, file, and domain
          - ‚úÖ PR-based workflow for grouped fixes
          - ‚úÖ More detailed context (branch, file, workflow info)
          - ‚úÖ Manual priority assignment with recommendations
          - ‚úÖ Prevention of duplicate issues across branches
          - ‚úÖ Copilot assigned to PRs instead of individual issues

          ### Status
          Run completed. Check logs above for details on issues processed.
          
          **Mode:** ${{ github.event.inputs.dry_run == 'true' && 'DRY RUN (preview only)' || 'ACTIVE (issues closed)' }}
