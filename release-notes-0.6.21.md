## 🔧 Fix Bootstrap Profile Mapping & Missing Files

### 🎯 Critical Issues Fixed

**The bootstrap "developer" profile now actually works!** No more missing SetupWizard errors.

### 🛠️ What Was Fixed

1. **Bootstrap Profile Mapping**
   - ❌ **Before**: "developer" downloaded "standard" package (missing SetupWizard)
   - ✅ **After**: "developer" now downloads "development" package (includes everything)

2. **Config File Paths**
   - ❌ **Before**: Looking for configs in `aither-core/configs/` but they were in `configs/`
   - ✅ **After**: Build now copies configs to BOTH locations for compatibility

3. **Standard Profile Enhancement**
   - ✅ Added SetupWizard module to standard profile
   - ✅ Added ProgressTracking module for better UX
   - Now works even if profile mapping isn't perfect

### 📋 Technical Details

**Bootstrap Profile Mapping Fixed:**
```powershell
# OLD (Broken)
'developer' { 'standard' }  # Missing SetupWizard!

# NEW (Fixed)  
'developer' { 'development' }  # Has everything!
```

**Build Process Fixed:**
- Configs now copied to both `configs/` AND `aither-core/configs/`
- Ensures compatibility regardless of where the app looks

**Standard Profile Enhanced:**
- Added SetupWizard (required for first-time setup)
- Added ProgressTracking (visual feedback)
- Now 0.4 MB (was 0.38 MB)

### 🚀 Bootstrap Now Works Correctly

```powershell
# Choose "developer" and it actually works now!
iex (irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wizzense/AitherZero/main/bootstrap.ps1")
```

When you select:
- **[1] Minimal** → Gets minimal package (5-8 MB)
- **[2] Developer** → Gets development package with ALL modules (35-50 MB) 
- **[3] Full** → Also gets development package (35-50 MB)

### 📦 Packages

- **AitherZero-0.6.21-minimal-windows.zip** - Core infrastructure (0.05 MB)
- **AitherZero-0.6.21-standard-windows.zip** - Production + SetupWizard (0.4 MB)
- **AitherZero-0.6.21-development-windows.zip** - Everything included (0.78 MB)
- **aitherzero-standard-windows-latest.zip** - Alias for standard
- **aitherzero-full-windows-latest.zip** - Alias for development

### ✅ What Now Works

- ✅ **Bootstrap "developer" profile** - Downloads correct package with SetupWizard
- ✅ **Config file loading** - Found in both possible locations
- ✅ **Standard profile backup** - Has SetupWizard even if mapping fails
- ✅ **First-time setup** - No more module not found errors
- ✅ **Clean installation** - All required files present

### 🎉 Summary

**The bootstrap installer finally works end-to-end!** You can now:
1. Run the bootstrap one-liner
2. Choose "developer" profile  
3. PowerShell 7 installs correctly
4. App launches with all modules present
5. SetupWizard runs for first-time configuration

No more "module not found" errors! 🚀
