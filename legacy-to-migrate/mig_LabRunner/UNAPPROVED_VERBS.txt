Unapproved verbs found in LabRunner module:
- Format-Config (Format is approved)
- Expand-All (Expand is approved)
- Get-GhDownloadArgs (Get is approved)
- Download-Archive (Download is NOT approved)
- Write-CustomLog (Write is approved)
- Read-LoggedInput (Read is approved)
- Get-MenuSelection (Get is approved)
- Invoke-OpenTofuInstaller (Invoke is approved)
- Test-IsAdmin (Test is approved)

The only unapproved verb is 'Download'.

PowerShell approved verbs for this action are: 'Get', 'Invoke', 'Start', 'Request', 'Receive', 'Send'.

Recommended replacement for 'Download-Archive':
- Invoke-ArchiveDownload
- Get-ArchiveDownload
- Receive-Archive

I will rename 'Download-Archive' to 'Invoke-ArchiveDownload' in the module and all references.
