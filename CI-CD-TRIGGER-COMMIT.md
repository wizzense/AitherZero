## What This Triggers
1. **CI Workflow**: Will run tests across Windows, Linux, macOS
2. **Release Workflow**: Will build cross-platform packages automatically
3. **GitHub Release**: Will create release with artifacts
4. **Package Artifacts**: Will generate real build artifacts

## Changes Made
- ✅ VERSION updated to 0.10.3
- ✅ Pipeline validation marker created
- ✅ CI/CD trigger commit marker created

## Expected Outcomes
- `AitherZero-v0.10.3-windows.zip` (automated build)
- `AitherZero-v0.10.3-linux.tar.gz` (automated build)
- `AitherZero-v0.10.3-macos.tar.gz` (automated build)
- GitHub release with all artifacts
- CI test results across all platforms

## Validation Goals
This proves the complete CI/CD pipeline works end-to-end, not just locally built packages.
