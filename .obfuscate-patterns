# Source Code Obfuscation Patterns
# 
# Files matching these patterns will be encrypted before commit
# when a valid license is present and obfuscation is enabled.
#
# Patterns use Git-style wildcards:
#   * matches any string (except /)
#   ** matches any string (including /)
#   ? matches any single character
#   [abc] matches any character in the set
#
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Example: Obfuscate all proprietary module files
# domains/proprietary/*.psm1
# domains/proprietary/*.ps1

# Example: Obfuscate specific sensitive scripts
# automation-scripts/9800_*.ps1
# automation-scripts/9900_*.ps1

# Example: Obfuscate entire directories
# proprietary/**/*.ps1
# proprietary/**/*.psm1

# To enable obfuscation:
# 1. Create a license: ./automation-scripts/0800_Manage-License.ps1 -Action Create
# 2. Uncomment patterns above or add your own
# 3. Run pre-commit: ./automation-scripts/0801_Obfuscate-PreCommit.ps1
