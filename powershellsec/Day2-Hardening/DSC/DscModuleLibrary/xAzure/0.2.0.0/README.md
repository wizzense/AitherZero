#xAzure

The **xAzure** module is a set of DSC resources that provide a method of depoying virtual machines in Microsoft Azure by applying a configuration to your local machine.
This is primarily intended to enable testing how a new virtual machine can be used to evaluate a scenario or application without consuming resources from the local machine.
  

 This module includes 6 DSC resources that automate provisioning of resources in Microsoft Azure.

*   **xAzureAffinityGroup** defines the relationship between compute and storage
*   **xAzureQuickVM** simple resource for creating VMs with limited options
*   **xAzureService** creates a cloud service for the VMs
*   **xAzureStorageAccount** creates the online storage account where the blobs for the test environment will reside
*   **xAzureSubscription** sets the current Azure subscription context
*   **xAzureVM** creates a virtual machine in Azure including access to VM Guest extensions
*   **xAzureVMDscConfiguration** packages and uploads a DSC Configuration for the DSC Extension
*   **xAzureVMDscExtension** uses the DSC Extension to apply a configuration within a VM
*   **xAzureSqlDatabase** creates Azure SQL Database
*   **xAzureSqlDatabaseServerFirewallRule** creates Azure SQL Database Server Firewall Rule

**All of the resources in the DSC Resource Kit are provided AS IS, and are not supported through any Microsoft standard support program or service.
The ""x" in xAzure stands for experimental**, which means that these resources will be **fix forward** and monitored by the module owner(s).

Please leave comments, feature requests, and bug reports in the Q & A tab for this module.

If you would like to modify **xAzure** module, feel free.
When modifying, please update the module name, resource friendly name, and MOF class name (instructions below).
As specified in the license, you may copy or modify this resource as long as they are used on the Windows Platform.

## Installation

To install **xAzure** module

*   If you are using WMF4 / PowerShell Version 4: Unzip the content under `$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules` folder
*   If you are using WMF5 Preview: From an elevated PowerShell session run `Install-Module xAzure`

To confirm installation:

*   Run **Get-DSCResource** to see that **xAzureAffinityGroup**, **xAzureQuickVM**, **xAzureVM**, and **xAzureVMDscExtension** are among the DSC Resources listed

## Requirements

This module requires the latest version of PowerShell (v4.0, which ships in Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012R2).
To easily use PowerShell 4.0 on older operating systems, [install WMF](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855).
Please read the installation instructions that are present on both the download page and the release notes for WMF 4.0.

 In addition, this module works based on the following assumptions: 
*   You have access to an Azure account.
This could be a trial account, a paid subscription, or Azure credit from an MSDN subscription.
*   You have installed the Windows Azure PowerShell cmdlets package from [WebPI](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx)
*   You have downloaded your Publish Settings file (.publishsettings) using Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile and have copied to the working directory set in the Create and SetupSubscription example scripts.
*   Open `.publishsettings` in Notepad and copy the name of the subscription to the Clipboard.
*   Open the `.\Create.ps1` script in the ExampleConfigScripts folder and update the name of your subscription and the location of your .publishsettings file in the xAzureSubscription section.

## Examples

The 'Examples' folder within the payload includes example configurations for common work streams:

*   **LCMApplyOnly** - Set the local DSC configuration to only apply configurations and not monitor or re-apply automatically
*   **Create** - Create environment including virtual machine
*   **Create_SqlDatabase** - Create Azure SQL Database
*   **Create_FirwallRule** - Create Azure SQL Database Server Firewall Rule
*   **Destroy** - Destroy everything created in by the Create script
*   **Remove** - Remove just the VM's and their VHD files from the test environment but leave the Affinity Group, Storage Account, and Cloud Service (quick re-provision scenario)
*   **SetupSubscription** - Setup the Azure subscription (remember that DSC is running as Local System)
*   **Status** - Retrieve information about a VM and optionally download the .rdp file, install the certificate, and create a reference PS remote file

**Understanding the INSTANCE ID: **  
 Instance ID - The Create script uses the last 10 places of the .NET time format named 'Ticks' to create a unique identifer for the accounts.
This is required because storage and service names must be globally unique - not just for your account - across all Azure customers.
The last step of the Create script is to return this number to the pipeline (along with the DSC output).
  
 You can capture the Instance ID by copying and pasting it from the PowerShell window, by copying and pasting it from the Azure website by opening the Cloud Service and selecting it from the title text, or you can automatically capture it from the pipeline using a variable.
 
```powershell
$test = .\Create.ps1 # In this example, the Instance ID would be returned as $test[1]  
.\Status.ps1 $test[1] -ConnectionFiles * In this example, the status of the VM is checked using the pipeline value.
```

**Note on credentials: **  
 When running the `.\Create.ps1` script, there is an immediate prompt for credentials.
The value collected here will be used to create the account inside the VM that is added to the local administrators group.
 
 **Note** - the password will be stored in clear text inside the MOF file in the example, however the resource has been designed to work with encrypted credentials.

**Understanding HOW TO TEST JEA:**  
 As a side benefit of this solution it is possible to test PowerShell Just Enough Administration.
Within the ScriptExtensionFiles folder you will find a script named InstallJEA.ps1\.
This delivers prerequisites for testing including downloads of the xJEA resource and WMF5, installing them both, and enabling remote access.
You have the option to remove comment blocks that would also execute steps inside the VM to configure JEA.
This provides flexibility to either test JEA on your own or have the script build out an endpoint automatically.
