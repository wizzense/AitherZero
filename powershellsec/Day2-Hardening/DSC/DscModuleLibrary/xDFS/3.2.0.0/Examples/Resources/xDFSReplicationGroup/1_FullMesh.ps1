    .EXAMPLE
    Create a DFS Replication Group called Public containing two members, FileServer1 and
    FileServer2. The Replication Group contains a single folder called Software. A description
    will be set on the Software folder and it will be set to exclude the directory Temp from
    replication. An automatic fullmesh topology is assigned to the replication group connections.
