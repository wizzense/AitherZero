    .EXAMPLE
    Create a DFS Replication Group called Public containing two members, FileServer1
    and FileServer2. The Replication Group contains two folders called Software and Misc.
    An automatic Full Mesh connection topology will be assigned. The Content Paths for each
    folder and member will be set to 'd:\public\software' and 'd:\public\misc' respectively.
