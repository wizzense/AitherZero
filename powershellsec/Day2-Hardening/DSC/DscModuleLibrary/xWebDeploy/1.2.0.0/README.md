# xWebDeploy

The **xWebDeploy** module contains the **xWebPackageDeploy** and **xWebDeploy** DSC resources for installing an IIS site using the WebDeploy IIS extension (MSWebDeploy version 3.5). 

## Contributing
Please check out common DSC Resources [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Resources

* **xWebDeploy** is a composite configuration that installs the WebDeploy 3.5 IIS extensions and deploys an IIS site from a given web package that was exported from a reference server suing MSWebDeploy 3.0 or 3.5. 
xWebDeploy supports Web Deploy sync, dump verbs, and iisApp and contentPath parameters. 
Note: This composite resource requires the **Package** resource that ships with PowerShell 4.0. 
* **xWebPackageDeploy** installs an IIS site from a given web deploy package formatted as a zip file. 

### xWebDeploy

* **SourcePath**: The full path on the filesystem where the web deploy package (as a zip file) is located. 
* **Destination**: The IIS content path or IIS site name to install the WebDeploy Zip package. 
* **WebDeployMsi**: The URI to download WebDeploy version 3.5.

### xWebPackageDeploy

* **SourcePath**: The full path on the filesystem where the web deploy package (as a zip file) is located. 
* **Destination**: The IIS content path or IIS site name to install the WebDeploy zip package. 
* **Ensure**: Ensures that the web package is installed: { Present | Absent }
