## Examples

Three example configurations are included in the Examples folder. All three examples also use the xSQLServer module.

### Single Server Installation

SCSMA-SingleServer.ps1 installs all SMA roles including prerequisites and SQL on a single server.

### Separate SQL

SCSMA-SeperateSQL.ps1 installs all SMA roles on one server and SQL on a separate server.

### Multiple Instances

SCSMA-MultiInstance.ps1 installs all SMA roles including multiple instances of both Web Service and Runbook Worker servers and SQL on a separate server.

### Remove Sample Runbooks

RemoveSampleRunbooks.ps1 removes SMA's default sample Runbooks.

###  Runbook Directory

RunbookDirectory.ps1 imports all Runbooks found in a directory that start with the name "Start-" and publishes them.

### SMA Variable

SmaVariable.ps1 adds a variable named "Variable" with value "Value" 

Notes:

The Single Server Installation, Separate SQL, and Multiple Instances examples use the exact same Configuration and just modify the behavior based on input ConfigurationData.

In the Examples folder you will see a version of each file with "-TP" appended to the name. 
These are the equivalent examples for deployment of System Center Technical Preview on Windows Server Technical Preview.

The samples require the use of the [Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 Preview.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398175)

System Center 2012 R2 Service Management Automation Web Service and Runbook Worker installers have a hard check for PowerShell 4.0. 
If you are using these resources to install on a system that has WMF 5.0 preview installed, you must copy the transform (MST) files from the Web Service and Runbook Worker DSC resource folders to the SMA installation folder.
