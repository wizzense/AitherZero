    .EXAMPLE
    Request and Accept a certificate from an Active Directory Root Certificate Authority.

    This example is allowing storage of credentials in plain text by setting PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword to $true.
    Storing passwords in plain text is not a good practice and is presented only for simplicity and demonstration purposes.
    To learn how to securely store credentials through the use of certificates,
    please refer to the following TechNet topic: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn781430.aspx
