.NAME
    OfficeOnlineServerFarm

# Description
    
    The OfficeOnlineServerFarm resource is used to create a new farm for either
    Office Web Apps 2013 or Office Online Server 2016. It requries that the binaries
    have already been installed, but when this is run it will establish a new farm. This
    means that this resource only needs to be used on the first server in a deployment,
    all other servers should use the OfficeOnlineServerMachine resource to join
    the farm.

.EXAMPLE
    This example shows how to create a basic web apps farm. There are many more options
    that can be configured on this resource, but this minimum configuration will deploy
    a farm that has editing enabled.


    Configuration Example 
    {
        param()

        Import-DscResource -ModuleName OfficeOnlineServerDsc

        OfficeOnlineServerFarm LocalFarm
        {
            InternalURL    = "https://officeonline.contoso.com"
            EditingEnabled = $true
        }
    }
