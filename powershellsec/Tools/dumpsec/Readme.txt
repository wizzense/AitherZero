                                Overview

Somarsoft DumpSec is a Windows NT program that will dump the permissions 
and audit settings for the file system, registry and printers in a consise,
readable listbox format, so that "holes" in system security are readily 
apparent. Somarsoft DumpSec also dumps user/group info. Somarsoft DumpSec is a 
must-have product for Windows NT systems administrators. 

Windows NT contains the mechanisms for providing strong system security, 
using permissions to control access to objects and auditing to log access.
However, it can be very difficult to determine if all permissions and audit
settings have been  set correctly, since there are so many files and registry 
keys on the typical system. The situation is analogous to having a building 
with unbreakable locks on each of 10,000 doors. The problem is not with the 
locks themselves, but rather with one person walking around and checking that 
none of the 10,000 doors is unlocked.

Somarsoft DumpSec provides a solution to the problem of too many files and
registry keys to check on a regular basis, by producing a consise and readable
report of permissions and/or audit settings. By reviewing this report,
you can determine if users have more access than you want to allow. You can 
then use file manager, registry editor or print manager to set permissions 
and audit settings differently.
