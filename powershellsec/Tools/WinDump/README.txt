WinDump is a Windows version of tcpdump, i.e., a command-line packet sniffer.

To run, it requires the npcap driver to be installed first, which is either installed separately or as a part of nmap.

Note that this is not the original WinDump that used the WinPcap driver.  This is a fork of that original tool and fork of that driver.
