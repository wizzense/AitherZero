.SYNOPSIS
    Automated GitHub issue resolution based on PR status
    
.DESCRIPTION
    This function handles automatic issue resolution when PRs are merged or closed:
    1. Monitors PR status changes
    2. Automatically closes issues when PRs are merged
    3. Keeps issues open when PRs are just closed (bug still needs fixing)
    4. Updates issue status with appropriate comments
    
.PARAMETER IssueNumber
    The GitHub issue number to monitor
    
.PARAMETER PullRequestNumber
    The associated PR number
    
.PARAMETER MonitorInterval
    How often to check PR status (default: 60 seconds)
    
.PARAMETER MaxMonitorHours
    Maximum time to monitor (default: 24 hours)
    
.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-GitHubIssueResolution -IssueNumber 123 -PullRequestNumber 45
    
.NOTES
    - Issues are only closed when PRs are merged (not just closed)
    - Closed PRs without merge keep the issue open for resubmission
    - Full audit trail of status changes
