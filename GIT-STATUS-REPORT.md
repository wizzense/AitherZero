# Git Status Report - June 29, 2025

## Current Situation

### Branch Status
- **Current Branch**: release/v1.0.0 (in sync with origin/release/v1.0.0)
- **Main Branch**: 5 commits ahead of origin/main (not diverged, just ahead)

### Unpushed Commits on Main
The following commits exist on local main but not on origin/main:
1. `1029be65` Add VERSION file for 1.0.0 release
2. `91381196` Final v1.0.0 release preparation
3. `7df0ea8b` Cleanup: Remove temporary recovery scripts
4. `3e3040a8` CRITICAL: Complete recovery and PatchManager safety enhancement
5. `55db59af` RECOVERY: Restore Phase 4 & 5 API Gateway implementation

These appear to be release preparation commits that were merged locally but not pushed.

### Analysis
- **No Divergence**: Main is only ahead, not behind origin/main
- **No Conflicts**: The branches are not in conflict
- **Release Branch**: Currently on release/v1.0.0 which is properly synced

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. New Sync-GitBranch Function
Created `/aither-core/modules/PatchManager/Public/Sync-GitBranch.ps1` to:
- Automatically detect and fix branch divergence
- Sync local branches with remote
- Clean up orphaned branches
- Validate tags

### 2. Fix-GitDivergence Script
Created `/scripts/Fix-GitDivergence.ps1` to:
- Backup current git state
- Fix diverged branches
- Clean up merged branches
- Remove duplicate tags
- Restore working directory

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md
Added comprehensive "Git Workflow Best Practices" section:
- Prevention strategies
- Daily workflow guidelines
- Manual operation warnings
- Fix procedures

### 4. VS Code Tasks
Added three new tasks:
- **Git: Sync Current Branch** - Quick sync with remote
- **Git: Fix Branch Divergence** - Full divergence fix
- **Git: Full Cleanup and Sync** - Complete cleanup

### 5. PatchManager Enhancement
- Updated module manifest to include Sync-GitBranch
- PatchManager already includes automatic sync in Invoke-PatchWorkflow
- Syncs with remote before creating new branches

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Push Release Commits**: If the v1.0.0 release is ready:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or Reset to Remote**: If these commits shouldn't be on main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

### Going Forward
1. **Always use PatchManager** for all git operations
2. **Run Sync-GitBranch** before starting new work
3. **Never commit directly to main**
4. **Use PR workflow** for all merges
5. **Fix divergence immediately** when detected

### Daily Workflow
```powershell
# Start of day
Import-Module ./aither-core/modules/PatchManager -Force
Sync-GitBranch -Force

# Make changes
Invoke-PatchWorkflow -PatchDescription "Your feature" -PatchOperation {
    # Changes here
} -CreatePR

# After PR merge
Invoke-PostMergeCleanup -BranchName "patch/your-branch"
```

## Prevention Measures

The following measures are now in place to prevent future divergence:

1. **Automatic Sync**: PatchManager syncs with remote before creating branches
2. **Stash Strategy**: Uncommitted changes are stashed, not committed to main
3. **Branch Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after PR merges
4. **Validation**: Regular validation of branch states
5. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines in CLAUDE.md

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/aither-core/modules/PatchManager/Public/Sync-GitBranch.ps1`
- `/scripts/Fix-GitDivergence.ps1`
- `/scripts/README-GitDivergence.md`
- `/GIT-STATUS-REPORT.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `/aither-core/modules/PatchManager/PatchManager.psd1` (added Sync-GitBranch)
- `/CLAUDE.md` (added Git Workflow Best Practices section)
- `/.vscode/tasks.json` (added 3 git sync tasks)

## Conclusion

The git divergence prevention system is now in place. The current situation with main being ahead of origin/main is not a divergence issue but rather unpushed commits that need a decision: either push them if they're ready for release, or reset if they shouldn't be on main.
