## Development Workflows

### Daily Development Workflow
1. **Environment Validation**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Validate-DevelopmentEnvironment.ps1
   ```

2. **Code Quality Checks**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Run-CodeQualityChecks.ps1 -Fix
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Run-DevelopmentTests.ps1
   ```

4. **Build Validation**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Build-DevelopmentPackage.ps1 -Validate
   ```

### Setup Workflow
1. **Initial Setup**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Setup-DevelopmentEnvironment.ps1 -Profile "Standard"
   ```

2. **Dependency Installation**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Install-DevelopmentDependencies.ps1
   ```

3. **Tool Configuration**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Configure-DevelopmentTools.ps1
   ```

4. **Environment Validation**
   ```powershell
   ./scripts/development/Validate-DevelopmentEnvironment.ps1
   ```

## Configuration

### Script Configuration
Scripts use configuration files located in:
- `configs/development/`: Development-specific configurations
- `configs/profiles/`: Profile-specific configurations
- `.vscode/`: VS Code specific configurations

### Environment Variables
- `AITHER_DEV_PROFILE`: Development profile
- `AITHER_DEV_TOOLS_PATH`: Development tools path
- `AITHER_DEV_CONFIG_PATH`: Development configuration path

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Run with appropriate permissions
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Install required dependencies
3. **Configuration Errors**: Validate configuration files
4. **Environment Issues**: Validate development environment

### Troubleshooting
```powershell
# Debug mode
./scripts/development/[Script-Name].ps1 -Debug

# Verbose output
./scripts/development/[Script-Name].ps1 -Verbose

# Validate environment
./scripts/development/Validate-DevelopmentEnvironment.ps1 -Detailed
```

## Integration

### VS Code Integration
Development scripts are integrated with VS Code tasks:
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → Select development script
- Configured in `.vscode/tasks.json`

### CI/CD Integration
Scripts are integrated with GitHub Actions:
- Automated execution on pull requests
- Scheduled execution for maintenance
- Build and deployment automation

### PatchManager Integration
Scripts work with PatchManager for development workflows:
- Automated code quality fixes
- Pre-commit validation
- Post-commit testing

## Performance Considerations

### Script Optimization
- Parallel execution where possible
- Efficient file operations
- Caching of frequently used data
- Memory management optimization

### Resource Management
- Cleanup of temporary files
- Efficient resource utilization
- Monitoring of resource usage
- Graceful error handling

## Best Practices
