## 📈 Health Scoring

The system calculates weighted health scores across multiple factors:

### Health Factors & Weights

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Test Coverage** | 30% | Module test coverage and quality |
| **Security Compliance** | 25% | Security scan results and compliance |
| **Code Quality** | 20% | PSScriptAnalyzer findings and standards |
| **Documentation Coverage** | 15% | README.md and documentation presence |
| **Module Health** | 10% | Module loading and basic functionality |

### Grade Scale

- **A** (90-100%) - Excellent health, production ready
- **B** (80-89%) - Good health, minor improvements needed
- **C** (70-79%) - Fair health, moderate attention required
- **D** (60-69%) - Poor health, significant improvements needed
- **F** (<60%) - Critical health, immediate attention required

## 🎯 Workflow Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### 1. Comprehensive Report Workflow (`.github/workflows/comprehensive-report.yml`)

**Primary automation** for report generation:

- **Triggers**: Daily schedule, manual dispatch, version testing
- **Outputs**: HTML reports, JSON data, GitHub artifacts
- **Duration**: ~10-15 minutes for full comprehensive report
- **Artifacts**: 90-day retention for reports, 30-day for audit data

#### 2. Existing Audit Workflows (Enhanced)

The system builds on existing workflows:

- `audit.yml` - Documentation, testing, duplicate detection
- `security-scan.yml` - Security scanning with multiple tools
- `code-quality-remediation.yml` - PSScriptAnalyzer with automated fixes

### Artifact Management

Reports are automatically uploaded as GitHub artifacts:

```yaml
# Download comprehensive report
artifacts:
  - name: comprehensive-report
    files: [aitherZero-comprehensive-report.html, report-summary.json]
    retention: 90 days
    
  - name: feature-map  
    files: [feature-map.json, feature-map.html]
    retention: 90 days
    
  - name: audit-results
    files: [audit-reports/**/*]
    retention: 30 days
```

## 🔍 Usage Examples

### Development Workflow

```powershell
# 1. Generate feature map to understand current state
./scripts/reporting/Generate-DynamicFeatureMap.ps1 -HtmlOutput

# 2. Run comprehensive analysis before major changes
./scripts/reporting/Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1 -IncludeDetailedAnalysis

# 3. Review HTML reports for action items
# Open: comprehensive-report.html and feature-map.html
```

- **Documentation** (`README.md`) - Coverage analysis
- **Audit Artifacts** (JSON) - Previous audit results
- **Git History** - Change tracking and trends

### Output Formats

- **HTML Reports** - Interactive dashboards with charts and drill-downs
- **JSON Data** - Machine-readable results for automation
- **GitHub Artifacts** - Downloadable reports with retention policies
- **GitHub Summaries** - Workflow-integrated status updates

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Missing Audit Data

**Problem**: Report shows "No data" for certain sections

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Ensure audit artifacts exist
ls ./audit-reports/

# Run individual audit scripts
./scripts/testing/Audit-TestCoverage.ps1 -GenerateHTML
./scripts/documentation/Analyze-ContentDeltas.ps1 -ExportChanges
```

#### 2. Module Analysis Failures

**Problem**: Some modules not appearing in feature map

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Check module manifests
Get-ChildItem ./aither-core/modules -Recurse -Filter "*.psd1" | ForEach-Object {
    try {
        Import-PowerShellDataFile $_.FullName | Out-Null
        Write-Host "✅ $($_.Name)" -ForegroundColor Green
    } catch {
        Write-Host "❌ $($_.Name): $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

#### 3. HTML Report Generation Errors

**Problem**: HTML report fails to generate

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Run with verbose output for debugging
./scripts/reporting/Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1 -VerboseOutput

# Check PowerShell version (7.0+ required)
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion

# Verify project root detection
. "./aither-core/shared/Find-ProjectRoot.ps1"
Find-ProjectRoot
```

#### 4. Workflow Permissions

**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow fails with permissions

**Solution**:
- Ensure `contents: write` permission for release creation
- Check `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope in repository settings
- Verify artifact upload permissions

### Performance Optimization

```powershell
# For large codebases, use targeted analysis
./scripts/reporting/Generate-DynamicFeatureMap.ps1 -ModulesPath "./specific-modules"

# Skip expensive operations for quick reports
./scripts/reporting/Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1 # Basic analysis only

# Use caching for repeated analysis
# Audit artifacts are cached for 24 hours by default
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### PatchManager Integration

```powershell
# Generate reports before major changes
New-Feature -Description "Add comprehensive reporting" -Changes {
    # Generate baseline report
    ./scripts/reporting/Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1 -ReportTitle "Pre-Change Baseline"
    
    # Make changes...
    
    # Generate post-change report
    ./scripts/reporting/Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1 -ReportTitle "Post-Change Validation"
}
```

### VS Code Integration

```json
// .vscode/tasks.json
{
    "label": "Generate Comprehensive Report",
    "type": "shell", 
    "command": "./scripts/reporting/Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1",
    "args": ["-VerboseOutput"],
    "group": "build",
    "presentation": {
        "echo": true,
        "reveal": "always"
    }
}
```

### External Tool Integration

```powershell
# Export data for external tools
$featureMap = Get-Content "./feature-map.json" | ConvertFrom-Json
$healthScore = $featureMap.Statistics

# Integration with monitoring systems
$healthData = @{
    timestamp = Get-Date
    version = "0.8.0"
    healthScore = $healthScore.OverallScore
    testCoverage = $healthScore.TestCoveragePercentage
}

# Send to monitoring endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://monitoring.example.com/api/health" -Method POST -Body ($healthData | ConvertTo-Json)
```

## 📚 Advanced Features

### Custom Health Scoring

```powershell
# Override health factor weights
$customWeights = @{
    TestCoverage = 0.4        # Increase test importance
    SecurityCompliance = 0.3   # Increase security importance  
    CodeQuality = 0.15
    DocumentationCoverage = 0.1
    ModuleHealth = 0.05
}

# Apply custom scoring (requires script modification)
```

### Trend Analysis

```powershell
# Historical health tracking
$previousReports = Get-ChildItem "./reports" -Filter "*-report-summary.json"
$trends = $previousReports | ForEach-Object {
    $data = Get-Content $_.FullName | ConvertFrom-Json
    @{
        Date = $data.timestamp
        HealthScore = $data.healthScore
        TestCoverage = $data.testCoverage
    }
}

# Analyze trends over time
$trends | Sort-Object Date | Format-Table
```

### Custom Report Templates

```powershell
# Create custom report sections
$customSections = @(
    @{
        Title = "Custom Analysis"
        Content = "Custom HTML content here"
        Priority = "High"
    }
)

# Include in comprehensive report (requires script modification)
```
