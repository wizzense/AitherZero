```

### Command Pattern
All new commands follow the established pattern:
```
/command [action] [options]
```

Examples:
- `/test run --suite quick --coverage`
- `/config switch --set production --backup`
- `/security scan --type full --fix`

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Command Aliases
Added convenient aliases for common operations:
- `/pr` → `/patchmanager workflow --create-pr`
- `/quick-test` → `/test run --suite quick`
- `/backup-now` → `/backup create --type full --encrypt`
- `/security-check` → `/security scan --type quick --fix`

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Structured error responses with actionable suggestions
- Automatic rollback options for failed operations
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Natural Language Support
Commands designed to be intuitive and conversational:
- "Run security scan and fix issues"
- "Create backup before deployment"
- "Switch to production configuration"

### 4. Integration Points
- **Module Integration**: Seamless use of existing AitherZero modules
- **CI/CD Integration**: Commands work with GitHub Actions
- **VS Code Integration**: Can be triggered from VS Code tasks
- **Cross-Command Integration**: Commands can call each other

## Benefits

### For Developers
1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simple commands for complex operations
2. **Faster Workflows**: Aliases and smart defaults
3. **Better Testing**: Quick validation before commits
4. **Safer Operations**: Built-in validation and rollback

### For Operations
1. **Automated Security**: Regular scans and compliance checks
2. **Reliable Backups**: Scheduled backups with verification
3. **Easy Recovery**: Disaster recovery procedures
4. **Workflow Automation**: Complex operations simplified

### For the Project
1. **Consistency**: Standardized command structure
2. **Discoverability**: Clear documentation and help
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new commands
4. **Maintainability**: Modular implementation

## Usage Examples

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Morning routine
/aither status --all
/test run --suite quick
/security scan --type quick

# Development work
/config switch --set dev
/patchmanager workflow --description "New feature" --create-pr
/test validate

# Before leaving
/backup create --name daily
/config switch --set default
```

### Deployment Workflow
```bash
# Pre-deployment
/test run --suite all
/backup create --type full --encrypt
/config validate --environment production

# Deployment
/orchestrate run --playbook deploy-app --environment production
/monitor status --real-time

# Post-deployment
/test run --suite integration --environment production
/security scan --target production
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Context-aware command recommendations
2. **Command Chaining**: Execute multiple commands in sequence
3. **Interactive Mode**: Step-by-step wizards for complex operations
4. **Command History**: Track and replay successful command sequences
5. **Team Sharing**: Share command workflows with team members

### Potential New Commands
- `/performance` - Performance analysis and optimization
- `/debug` - Advanced debugging and troubleshooting
- `/report` - Comprehensive reporting across all modules
- `/assistant` - AI-powered assistant for complex tasks

## Technical Details

### PowerShell Integration
- All scripts require PowerShell 7.0+
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Module auto-loading with dependency resolution

### Security Considerations
- Commands respect existing permissions
- Sensitive operations require confirmation
