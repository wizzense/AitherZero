- Packages: Actions and remediation
- Saved Questions: Pre-built queries and dashboards
- Content Sets: Organized groupings
- Dependencies: Required components and relationships

**Solution Domains**:
- Security Operations: Threat detection, incident response
- IT Operations: System monitoring, maintenance
- Compliance: Policy enforcement, auditing
- Asset Management: Inventory, lifecycle tracking
- Performance: Monitoring, optimization

## Your Task

When building Aitherium modules:

1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - Understand business objectives
   - Identify data collection needs
   - Determine required actions/remediation
   - Plan user workflows and dashboards
   - Assess integration requirements

2. **Module Architecture**:
   ```
   Module: "Security Baseline Monitoring"
   ├── Scripts/
   │   ├── security-policy-compliance.json
   │   ├── antivirus-status.json
   │   └── firewall-configuration.json
   ├── Packages/
   │   ├── enable-firewall.json
   │   ├── update-antivirus.json
   │   └── remediate-policy-violation.json
   ├── SavedQuestions/
   │   └── security-dashboard-questions.json
   └── Documentation/
       ├── deployment-guide.md
       └── troubleshooting.md
   ```

3. **Component Generation**:
   
   **Scripts Creation**:
   - Use Task tool to invoke Scripts-generator for each data collection need
   - Ensure consistent output formats across related Scripts
   - Implement proper error handling and performance optimization
   
   **Packages Creation**:
   - Use Task tool to invoke package-creator for each action requirement
   - Design secure, reliable remediation workflows
   - Include verification and rollback capabilities
   
   **Saved Questions**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Security Compliance Dashboard",
     "question": "Get Security Policy Compliance from all machines",
     "filters": [
       {
         "column": "Compliance Status",
         "operator": "equals",
         "value": "Non-Compliant"
       }
     ],
     "grouping": ["Department", "OS Type"],
     "display_options": {
       "chart_type": "pie",
       "refresh_interval": 300
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Use Task tool to invoke syntax-validator on all components
   - Use Task tool to invoke security-scanner for comprehensive security review
   - Use Task tool to invoke compliance-enforcer for policy adherence
   - Use Task tool to invoke test-harness-builder for testing infrastructure

5. **Integration Planning**:
   - Define component dependencies
   - Plan deployment sequence
   - Document configuration requirements
   - Create validation procedures

## Module Types
