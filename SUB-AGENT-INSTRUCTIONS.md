# Sub-Agent Instructions for AitherZero v1.0.0 MVP Recovery

## ðŸŽ¯ MASTER OBJECTIVE
Get the AitherZero MVP fully operational with working CI/CD, comprehensive testing, automated reporting, and all development best practices WITHOUT compromising on quality, testing, or validation.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL SUB-AGENTS

### 1. MANDATORY FIRST ACTION
**ALWAYS** create a working branch using PatchManager as your FIRST action:
```powershell
New-Patch -Description "Fix [specific issue description]"
```
**If PatchManager fails, this is a BLOCKER that must be fixed immediately.**

### 2. TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- **TEST EVERYTHING LOCALLY** before committing
- **VALIDATE SYNTAX** for all YAML and PowerShell changes
- **RUN TESTS** that validate your changes work
- **TRIGGER WORKFLOWS** to verify GitHub Actions work correctly

### 3. QUALITY GATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- No syntax errors in any file
- All tests must pass
- All workflows must complete successfully
- All artifacts must be generated correctly
- Full documentation of changes

### 4. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
- Report status immediately upon task start
- Report any blocking issues IMMEDIATELY
- Provide detailed results and validation proof
- Document rollback procedures for major changes

## ðŸ“‹ SUB-AGENT TASK ASSIGNMENTS

### **AGENT 1: CI WORKFLOW SYNTAX FIXER**
**Task**: Fix PowerShell syntax error in CI workflow (CRITICAL BLOCKER)

**Objective**: Fix the PowerShell syntax error in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that's causing all CI runs to fail.

**Specific Problem**: 
- File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Lines: 104-106
- Issue: `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path $files` where `$files` is an array but parameter expects string

**Required Actions**:
1. **Create branch**: `New-Patch -Description "Fix CI workflow PowerShell syntax error blocking all CI runs"`
2. **Analyze the problem**: Read the CI workflow file and identify the exact syntax issue
3. **Fix the syntax**: Convert the array handling to proper string paths for PSScriptAnalyzer
4. **Test locally**: Validate the PowerShell syntax works correctly
5. **Commit and push**: Trigger CI to validate the fix works

**Objective**: Debug and resolve the startup failures in `comprehensive-report.yml` to restore dashboard generation.

**Required Actions**:
1. **Create branch**: `New-Patch -Description "Fix comprehensive reporting workflow startup failures"`
2. **Analyze failures**: Investigate why the workflow has startup failures
3. **Check dependencies**: Ensure all required scripts and modules exist
4. **Fix missing components**: Add or fix any missing dependencies
5. **Test workflow**: Manually trigger the workflow to validate it works
6. **Validate outputs**: Ensure HTML dashboard and all artifacts are generated
