# Duplicate CI Run Fix - Summary

## Issue Description
When a Pull Request was updated with new commits, GitHub Actions workflows were running twice simultaneously with both `(push)` and `(pull_request)` event types, causing:
- 🔄 Redundant workflow runs (2x resource usage)
- ⏰ Longer wait times for results
- 😕 Confusion with duplicate check runs in the UI
- 💰 Wasted CI/CD minutes

### Example from Problem Statement
```
Intelligent CI Orchestrator / 🌍 Cross-Platform (macos-latest) (push) — Queued
Intelligent CI Orchestrator / 🌍 Cross-Platform (ubuntu-latest) (push) — Queued
Intelligent CI Orchestrator / 🔍 Core Validation (pull_request) — Running
Intelligent CI Orchestrator / 🔒 Security Validation (pull_request) — Running
Intelligent CI Orchestrator / 🔒 Security Validation (push) — Running
```

## Root Cause
Workflows had both triggers configured:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, 'feature/**', 'copilot/**']  # ❌ Includes PR branches
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

When a PR branch (e.g., `copilot/my-feature`) received new commits:
1. GitHub fired a `push` event → Workflow started with `(push)`
2. GitHub fired a `pull_request synchronize` event → Workflow started with `(pull_request)`
3. Result: **Same code tested twice in parallel**

## Solution
Restrict `push` trigger to only base branches that don't have PRs:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    # Only run on base branches to avoid duplicate runs with pull_request events
    # Feature branches and copilot branches are tested via pull_request event
    branches: [main, develop]  # ✅ Only base branches
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

## Modified Workflows

| Workflow | Change | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `quality-validation.yml` | Uses pull_request trigger for PR validation | PR updates only trigger once |
| `validate-config.yml` | Added `branches: [main, develop]` to push trigger | Config validation only runs once per PR update |
| `validate-manifests.yml` | Added `branches: [main, develop]` to push trigger | Manifest validation only runs once per PR update |

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
PR Update (git push origin copilot/my-branch)
  ├─ push event → Workflow Run #123 (push)
  └─ pull_request event → Workflow Run #124 (pull_request)
Result: 2 runs, 2x cost, 2x confusion ❌
```

### After Fix
```
PR Update (git push origin copilot/my-branch)
  ├─ push event → ❌ Skipped (branch not in [main, develop])
  └─ pull_request event → Workflow Run #123 (pull_request)
Result: 1 run, normal cost, clear status ✅
```

## Coverage Maintained

| Scenario | Before | After | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Push to PR branch (copilot/*, feature/*) | 2 runs (push + PR) | 1 run (PR only) | ✅ Fixed |
| Push directly to `main` | 1 run (push) | 1 run (push) | ✅ Unchanged |
| Push directly to `develop` | 1 run (push) | 1 run (push) | ✅ Unchanged |
| Create new PR | 1 run (PR) | 1 run (PR) | ✅ Unchanged |

## Verification Steps

1. **Create a test PR from a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/duplicate-fix
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Test commit"
   git push origin test/duplicate-fix
   # Create PR via GitHub UI
   ```

2. **Push a new commit to the PR:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Another test commit"
   git push origin test/duplicate-fix
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Should see **only** `(pull_request)` runs
   - Should **NOT** see `(push)` runs for the test branch

4. **Check workflow run labels:**
   ```
   ✅ Intelligent CI Orchestrator / 🔍 Core Validation (pull_request)
   ✅ Validate Config Manifest (pull_request)
   ✅ Validate PowerShell Module Manifests (pull_request)
   
   ❌ No (push) runs should appear for feature/copilot branches
   ```

## Benefits

- ⚡ **50% reduction** in workflow runs for PR updates
- 💰 **50% cost savings** on CI/CD minutes for PR testing
- 🎯 **Clearer status checks** - one run per update
- ⏱️ **Faster feedback** - no queued duplicate runs
- 🧹 **Cleaner Actions UI** - no confusing duplicate entries
