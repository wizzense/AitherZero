   - 0851_Cleanup-PREnvironment.ps1 - Fully functional
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Support for multiple deployment targets

5. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - PR deployment workflow properly configured
   - Automated triggers working (PR events, comments, manual)
   - Container build and push to GHCR
   - Docker Compose deployment
   - Health checks and smoke tests
   - **NEW:** Validation step added before build

6. **Documentation**

### ⚠️ Minor Observation (1)

**Single-stage Docker Build**
- Status: Not critical
- Impact: Minimal
- Reason: Acceptable for PowerShell application
- Recommendation: Consider multi-stage if image size becomes a concern
- Current image size is reasonable for the use case

**Workflow Sequence:**
1. Check deployment trigger
2. **→ Validate Docker configuration** (NEW)
3. Build container image (only if validation passes)
4. Deploy with Docker Compose
5. Run smoke tests
6. Comment deployment status (includes validation status)

### 3. Documentation

**PR-DOCKER-DEPLOYMENT-VALIDATION.md**
- Complete validation results
- Test result breakdown by category
- Architecture documentation
- Security analysis
- Performance metrics
- Deployment workflow overview
- Recommendations
- Validation methodology
