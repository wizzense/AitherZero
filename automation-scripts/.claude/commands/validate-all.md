description: Run validation on all content in the system
---

## Your Task

Perform comprehensive validation on ALL content in the analyzed folder.

1. Create a todo list of all content to validate:
   - Find all JSON files in ./analyzed/Scripts/
   - Find all JSON files in ./analyzed/packages/
   - Track total count and types

2. For each content item, run these validations concurrently:
   - Use the Task tool to invoke syntax-validator agent for all platforms
   - Use the Task tool to invoke security-scanner agent for vulnerability scanning
   - Use the Task tool to invoke performance-analyzer agent for impact assessment
   - Use the Task tool to invoke compliance-enforcer agent for best practices
   - Use the Task tool to invoke quality-gatekeeper agent for final validation

3. Categorize findings by severity:
   - 🔴 CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, syntax errors
   - 🟠 HIGH: Performance issues, missing error handling
   - 🟡 MEDIUM: Best practice violations, incomplete docs
   - 🟢 LOW: Minor improvements, style suggestions

4. Generate validation summary:
   ```

   ```

5. Create actionable reports:
   - Full validation report in ./reports/validation-[date].md
   - Priority fix list for critical issues
   - Batch remediation suggestions

6. Update the database with validation status for each item.

This comprehensive validation helps ensure all content meets quality standards before deployment.
