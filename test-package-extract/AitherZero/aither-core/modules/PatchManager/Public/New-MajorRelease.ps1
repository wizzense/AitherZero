.SYNOPSIS
    Complete workflow automation for major releases - sync, branch, PR, merge, release

.DESCRIPTION
    This function provides a one-liner command to handle the complete release workflow:
    1. Sync with remote (git pull origin main)
    2. Create feature branch with all staged changes
    3. Commit changes with proper categorization
    4. Push branch and create PR
    5. Optionally auto-merge PR
    6. Create release tag and trigger release workflow
    7. Verify functionality

    This function was created to address the need for complete workflow automation
    beyond the individual New-Feature/New-Patch functions.

.PARAMETER Description
    Description of the major release changes

.PARAMETER Version
    Target version for the release (e.g., "0.8.0")

.PARAMETER Changes
    Script block containing any additional changes to apply

.PARAMETER AutoMerge
    Automatically merge the PR (requires appropriate permissions)

.PARAMETER SkipTests
    Skip test validation before release

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Preview the workflow without making changes

.EXAMPLE
    New-MajorRelease -Description "Comprehensive test infrastructure overhaul" -Version "0.8.0" -Changes {
        Write-Host "All test improvements from 10 sub-agents applied"
    }

.EXAMPLE
    New-MajorRelease -Description "Major feature release" -Version "1.0.0" -AutoMerge -Changes {
        # Additional release preparation
        Update-Documentation
    }

.NOTES
    PatchManager v3.0 Enhancement - Complete workflow automation
    Requires appropriate GitHub permissions for auto-merge functionality
