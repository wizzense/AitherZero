- `Remove-SecureCredential` - Securely remove credentials
- `Export-SecureCredentialAudit` - Generate credential audit reports
- `Import-SecureCredentialFromVault` - Import from external credential vaults

### SecurityAutomation (31 functions)
**Original Module**: `aither-core/modules/SecurityAutomation/`  
**Status**: âœ… Consolidated (Security Provider)  
**Purpose**: Automated security hardening, compliance monitoring, and PKI management

**Key Functions**:
- `Get-ADSecurityAssessment` - Comprehensive Active Directory security analysis
- `Enable-CredentialGuard` - Enable Windows Credential Guard protection

- `Set-WindowsFirewallRules` - Configure Windows Firewall rules

## Security Architecture

The security domain maintains strict security boundaries:

```
Security Domain
â”œâ”€â”€ SecureCredentials (Core Service)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Credential Storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Encryption Management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Access Control
â””â”€â”€ SecurityAutomation (Security Provider)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Active Directory Security
    â”œâ”€â”€ Certificate Services
    â”œâ”€â”€ System Hardening
    â””â”€â”€ Compliance Management
```

## Implementation Structure

```
security/
â”œâ”€â”€ SecureCredentials.ps1       # Core credential management
â”œâ”€â”€ SecurityAutomation.ps1      # Security automation provider

```

## Security Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Security functions isolated from other domains
2. **Least Privilege**: Functions operate with minimal required permissions
3. **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all security operations
5. **Compliance**: Adherence to enterprise security standards

## Usage Examples

```powershell
# Secure credential management
$cred = Get-SecureCredential -Name "ServiceAccount"
Set-SecureCredential -Name "DatabaseConnection" -Credential $dbCred

# Security automation
$assessment = Get-ADSecurityAssessment -DomainName "company.com"
Enable-CredentialGuard -Force

# Certificate management
Install-EnterpriseCA -CAName "CompanyCA" -CAType "EnterpriseRootCA"
```

## Security Features

### SecureCredentials Service
- **Enterprise-grade encryption**: AES-256 encryption for credential storage
- **Access control**: Role-based access to credentials
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all credential operations
- **Compliance validation**: Ensures credentials meet security policies

### SecurityAutomation Provider
- **Active Directory security**: AD security assessment and hardening
- **Certificate services**: PKI management and certificate automation
- **System hardening**: Automated security configuration
- **Compliance monitoring**: Continuous compliance validation

## Security Boundaries

The security domain maintains strict boundaries:

1. **Data Isolation**: Security data isolated from other domains
2. **Function Isolation**: Security functions cannot be called by other domains directly
3. **Audit Isolation**: Security audit logs separate from application logs
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access control for all security functions

## Testing

Security domain tests are located in:
- `tests/domains/security/`
- Security integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Compliance tests in `tests/compliance/`

## Dependencies

- **Write-CustomLog**: Guaranteed available from AitherCore orchestration
- **Configuration Services**: Uses secure configuration management
- **Platform Services**: Cross-platform security operations
