## Quick Answer: What Should We Do Next?

**The top 3 immediate priorities are:**

1. **Merge and publish existing work** (PR #1700, PR #1660) - Get work out the door
2. **Publish to PowerShell Gallery** - Expand user reach dramatically
3. **Build community presence** - Create visibility and engagement

These actions will maximize impact with minimal effort and unlock significant growth opportunities.

gh pr view 1700

# Test locally
gh pr checkout 1700
./automation-scripts/0510_generate-project-report.ps1 -ShowAll

# If tests pass, merge
gh pr merge 1700 --squash
```

**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Impact**: High - Improves user experience and metrics accuracy

#### PR #1660 - Publishing Infrastructure
**Status**: Production-ready  
**What it does**: Enables PowerShell Gallery publishing, WinGet manifests

**Actions**:
```bash
# Review the PR
gh pr view 1660

# Verify workflow syntax

# Merge
gh pr merge 1660 --squash
```

**Time**: 20 minutes  
**Impact**: Very High - Unlocks distribution to thousands of PowerShell users

### 🚀 Priority 2: Publish to PowerShell Gallery

**Prerequisites**: PR #1660 merged

#### Step 1: Get PowerShell Gallery API Key
```powershell
# Create account at https://www.powershellgallery.com
# Navigate to Account > API Keys
# Create new key named "AitherZero-GitHub-Actions"
# Copy the key
```

#### Step 2: Add Secret to GitHub
```bash
# Via GitHub UI
# Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
# Name: PSGALLERY_API_KEY
# Value: <paste key>

# Or via GitHub CLI
gh secret set PSGALLERY_API_KEY
```

#### Step 3: Create Release Tag
```bash
# This will trigger both release workflow AND PSGallery publish
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -a v1.0.0.0 -m "Initial PowerShell Gallery release"
git push origin v1.0.0.0
```

#### Step 4: Verify Publication
```bash
# Wait 10-15 minutes for workflows to complete
# Check workflow status
gh run list --limit 5

# Test installation (after ~30 min for PSGallery indexing)
Install-Module -Name AitherZero -Scope CurrentUser
Get-Module -Name AitherZero -ListAvailable
```

**Time**: 1 hour (including waiting for workflows)  
**Impact**: Very High - Makes AitherZero discoverable to entire PowerShell community

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None identified

### Potential Risks
1. **PSGallery API key delay**: Mitigation: Create account immediately
2. **Workflow failures**: Mitigation: Test workflows before release tag
3. **Time constraints**: Mitigation: Focus on top 3 priorities only

---

## Questions for Stakeholders

Before proceeding, confirm:

1. **Approval to merge PRs**: Are #1700 and #1660 approved for merge?
2. **PSGallery account**: Who will create/manage the PowerShell Gallery account?
3. **Release timing**: Is there a preferred date/time for v1.0.0.0 publication?
4. **Community engagement**: Who will manage Reddit/Twitter announcements?
5. **Documentation hosting**: Confirm GitHub Pages is acceptable for docs?
