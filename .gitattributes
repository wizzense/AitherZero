# Git Attributes for AitherZero

# Auto-generated index.md files should always use "ours" (current branch) version during merges
# This prevents merge conflicts when multiple branches update these files
# The files will be regenerated after merge anyway by the index-automation workflow
#
# Note: This requires the merge driver to be configured in git config:
#   git config merge.ours.driver "true"
# Or for the custom script:
#   git config merge.ours.driver ".github/scripts/merge-ours.sh %O %A %B %L %P"
**/index.md merge=ours linguist-generated=true
