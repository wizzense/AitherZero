## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Merge PRs without testing locally  
✅ **Do**: `gh pr checkout <number>` and validate

❌ **Don't**: Push release tag before workflows are ready  
✅ **Do**: Verify PSGALLERY_API_KEY is configured first

❌ **Don't**: Announce before PSGallery is live  
✅ **Do**: Wait for indexing (~30 min) and test install

❌ **Don't**: Create issues without templates  
✅ **Do**: Set up templates first for better quality

❌ **Don't**: Ignore community engagement  
✅ **Do**: Respond to discussions within 24 hours

## 🎯 Remember

> "The work is done. We just need to ship it and tell people about it."

**Focus on**:
- Shipping existing work (PRs)
- Making it discoverable (PSGallery)
- Building community (engagement)

**Not right now**:
- New features (focus on adoption first)
- Major refactoring (v1.0.0.0 is solid)
- Complex infrastructure (keep it simple)
