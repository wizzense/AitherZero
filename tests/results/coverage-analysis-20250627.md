- **127 total test files** found in the test directory
- **15 modules** in the project

### Module Coverage Breakdown

#### Modules WITH Tests:
1. ✅ BackupManager - Has tests
2. ✅ DevEnvironment - Has tests (Core & Comprehensive)
3. ✅ ISOCustomizer - Has tests
4. ✅ ISOManager - Has tests
5. ✅ LabRunner - Has tests (Core)
6. ✅ Logging - Has tests (Core)
7. ✅ OpenTofuProvider - Has tests
8. ✅ ParallelExecution - Has tests (Core)
9. ✅ PatchManager - Has tests (Multiple: Validation, CrossFork, etc.)
10. ✅ RemoteConnection - Has tests

## Files/Functions with NO Test Coverage

### Core Application Files
- `/aither-core/aither-core.ps1` - 0% coverage (219 lines)
- `/aither-core/AitherCore.psm1` - 0% coverage (216 lines)

### Missing Function Coverage
Based on the coverage report, the following functions have 0% coverage:
- Invoke-ScriptWithOutputHandling
- Write-CustomLog
- Invoke-CoreApplication
- Start-LabRunner
- Get-CoreConfiguration
- Test-CoreApplicationHealth
- Get-PlatformInfo
- Initialize-CoreApplication
- Import-CoreModules
- Get-CoreModuleStatus
- Invoke-UnifiedMaintenance
- Start-DevEnvironmentSetup

## Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Failing Tests (50+ failures)
1. **OpenTofuProvider**: Fix certificate path issues and object generation
2. **TestingFramework**: Mock Pester calls and file system operations
3. **ParallelExecution**: Fix runspace and job management tests
4. **RemoteConnection**: Fix module loading and integration tests
5. **RepoSync**: Add proper git mocking for tests
6. **Core Runner**: Fix path resolution and concurrent execution

### Priority 2: Increase Core Coverage
1. Add tests for `aither-core.ps1` main script
2. Add tests for `AitherCore.psm1` module functions
3. Ensure all exported functions have at least basic tests

### Priority 3: Add Comprehensive Tests
1. Expand "Core" tests to full coverage for each module
2. Add integration tests between modules
3. Add end-to-end workflow tests

### Priority 4: Enable Coverage Reporting
1. Configure Pester to generate coverage reports during test runs
2. Set up coverage thresholds (aim for 80%+)
3. Add coverage badges to README

## Test Execution Commands

```powershell
# Quick validation (currently passing)
./tests/Run-BulletproofValidation.ps1 -ValidationLevel Quick

# Standard validation (currently failing)
./tests/Run-BulletproofValidation.ps1 -ValidationLevel Standard

# Run with coverage (needs configuration)
./tests/Run-BulletproofValidation.ps1 -ValidationLevel Standard -CodeCoverage
```

## Estimated Effort
- Fix failing tests: 2-3 days
- Add missing core tests: 3-4 days
- Comprehensive coverage: 1-2 weeks
- Total to 100% coverage: ~3 weeks
