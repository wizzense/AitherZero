## Automatic Report Generation

As of 2025-08-11, automatic report generation is now configured:

### Automatic Triggers:
1. **After Test Runs**: Reports are automatically generated after running tests (0402, 0403, 0411)
2. **Daily Schedule**: Reports can be scheduled to run daily at 09:00 AM
3. **Manual Trigger**: Use `./az 0510` to generate reports on-demand

### Configuration:
- Reports are generated in all formats (HTML, JSON, Markdown)
- Old reports are automatically cleaned up after 3 days to save space
- Hook integration ensures reports are triggered after important operations

### Schedule Management:
```powershell
# Enable daily reports
./automation-scripts/0512_Schedule-ReportGeneration.ps1 -Schedule Daily -Time "09:00"

# Generate reports after every test run
./automation-scripts/0512_Schedule-ReportGeneration.ps1 -Schedule OnTestRun

# Disable automatic generation
./automation-scripts/0512_Schedule-ReportGeneration.ps1 -Schedule Disable
```

## How to Use the Reports

### Generate Fresh Reports:
```powershell
# Generate all report formats
./automation-scripts/0510_Generate-ProjectReport.ps1 -Format All

# Generate specific format
./automation-scripts/0510_Generate-ProjectReport.ps1 -Format HTML
```

### View Live Dashboard:
```powershell
# Show complete dashboard
./automation-scripts/0511_Show-ProjectDashboard.ps1 -ShowAll

# Follow logs in real-time
./automation-scripts/0511_Show-ProjectDashboard.ps1 -ShowLogs -Follow

# Show only metrics
./automation-scripts/0511_Show-ProjectDashboard.ps1 -ShowMetrics
```

### Access Reports:
- HTML Reports: Open `tests/reports/ProjectReport-*.html` in a browser
- JSON Reports: `tests/reports/ProjectReport-*.json` for automation
- This Summary: `tests/reports/DASHBOARD-SUMMARY.md`

## Areas Needing Attention

1. **Documentation**: Only 8.85% of functions have help - needs major improvement
2. **Comment Ratio**: 10.97% is below industry standard of 20%+
3. **Test Coverage**: Need to implement actual test execution and coverage measurement
4. **Logging**: Log files not being created - need to ensure logging is initialized
5. **Code Quality**: 8 PSScriptAnalyzer warnings need to be addressed

## Next Steps

1. Fix PSScriptAnalyzer warnings
2. Add comment-based help to all functions
3. Implement code coverage measurement
4. Ensure logging is properly initialized
5. Create more comprehensive unit tests
