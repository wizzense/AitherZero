## Areas Needing Attention

1. **Documentation**: Only 8.85% of functions have help - needs major improvement
2. **Comment Ratio**: 10.97% is below industry standard of 20%+
3. **Test Coverage**: Need to implement actual test execution and coverage measurement
4. **Logging**: Log files not being created - need to ensure logging is initialized
5. **Code Quality**: 8 PSScriptAnalyzer warnings need to be addressed

## Next Steps

1. Fix PSScriptAnalyzer warnings
2. Add comment-based help to all functions
3. Implement code coverage measurement
4. Ensure logging is properly initialized
5. Create more comprehensive unit tests
