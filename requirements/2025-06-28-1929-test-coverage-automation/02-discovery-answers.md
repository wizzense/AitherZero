Status: Answered - Moving to Implementation Planning

## Question Responses

### Q1: Test Fixing Priority
**Answer: Yes**
- **Decision**: Fix existing ~50 syntax errors and failing tests BEFORE adding new coverage
- **Reasoning**: Establish a working baseline for reliable test execution
- **Impact**: Creates stable foundation for coverage expansion

### Q2: Coverage Target Flexibility  
**Answer: Yes**
- **Decision**: 80% test coverage acceptable for initial release
- **Reasoning**: Significant improvement from current ~0%, industry standard for production
- **Impact**: Achievable and measurable target for v1.0 release

### Q3: Automated Test Generation
**Answer: Yes**
- **Decision**: Use automated test generation tools for baseline tests
- **Reasoning**: 15 modules + 42 scripts = automation will accelerate coverage significantly
- **Impact**: Rapid baseline establishment, can refine manually afterward

### Q4: CI/CD Integration Priority
**Answer: Yes** 
- **Decision**: Full GitHub Actions CI/CD integration before release
- **Reasoning**: Ensures tests run on every commit/PR, prevents regression
- **Impact**: Continuous quality assurance and team confidence

### Q5: End-to-End Testing Scope
**Answer: No**
- **Decision**: Focus on unit/integration tests for initial release
- **Reasoning**: E2E tests complex and time-consuming, can follow in v1.1
- **Impact**: Manageable scope for initial release, comprehensive unit coverage

## Implementation Priorities

Based on answers, the implementation will follow this priority order:

1. **Fix Existing Tests** (Critical foundation)
2. **Automated Test Generation** (Rapid coverage boost)
3. **CI/CD Integration** (Continuous validation)
4. **Manual Test Refinement** (Quality improvement)
5. **Coverage Reporting** (Progress tracking)

## Success Criteria Defined

- ✅ All existing tests pass without syntax errors
- ✅ 80% code coverage across all modules
- ✅ Automated test generation for uncovered code
- ✅ GitHub Actions integration with coverage reporting
- ✅ Documentation for test maintenance and expansion
