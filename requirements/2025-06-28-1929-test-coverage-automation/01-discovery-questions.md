# Phase 1: Context Discovery Questions

Based on my analysis of your codebase, I need to understand your priorities and constraints for achieving 100% test coverage. Please answer these yes/no questions:

## Question 1: Test Fixing Priority
**Should we prioritize fixing the existing ~50 syntax errors and failing tests BEFORE adding new test coverage?**
- Default: **Yes** (fix existing tests first to establish a working baseline)
- Context: Multiple test files have syntax errors preventing execution, and there are 50+ test failures

## Question 2: Coverage Target Flexibility  
**Is 80% test coverage acceptable for the initial release instead of 100%?**
- Default: **Yes** (80% is industry standard for production code)
- Context: Current coverage is ~0%, achieving 80% would be significant improvement

## Question 3: Automated Test Generation
**Should we use automated test generation tools to create baseline tests for all modules?**
- Default: **Yes** (speeds up initial coverage, can refine later)
- Context: With 15 modules and 42 scripts, automation would significantly accelerate coverage

## Question 4: CI/CD Integration Priority
**Should the test suite be fully integrated with GitHub Actions CI/CD before the initial release?**
- Default: **Yes** (ensures tests run on every commit/PR)
- Context: CI workflows exist but need test integration

## Question 5: End-to-End Testing Scope
**Should we include full end-to-end tests for the complete workflow (quickstart â†’ OpenTofu deployment) in the initial release?**
- Default: **No** (focus on unit/integration tests first, E2E can follow)
- Context: E2E tests are complex and time-consuming for initial release
