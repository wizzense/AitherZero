# Discovery Questions - Phase 1

Based on my analysis of the AitherZero module architecture, I need to understand your priorities and constraints. Please answer these yes/no questions:

## Question 1: Module Consolidation Strategy
**Should we maintain the current modular architecture where each module has a specific responsibility (like LabRunner for lab automation, Logging for logs, etc.) rather than consolidating into larger super-modules?**

Default: Yes (maintain modular architecture for better separation of concerns)

---

## Question 2: Build Package Scope
**Should all discovered modules (including ConfigurationCarousel, OrchestrationEngine, etc.) be included in the standard build packages, or should we create multiple package types (minimal, standard, full)?**

Default: No (create multiple package types for different use cases)

---

## Question 3: Module Dependency Management
**Should modules explicitly declare their dependencies on other modules in their manifests (RequiredModules) to ensure proper loading order?**

Default: Yes (explicit dependencies improve reliability and documentation)

---

## Question 4: Backwards Compatibility
**Do we need to maintain backwards compatibility with existing scripts that import modules directly (e.g., scripts that do `Import-Module LabRunner`)?**

Default: Yes (many existing scripts depend on current module structure)

---

## Question 5: Module Interface Standardization
**Should all modules follow a standardized interface pattern (e.g., each module must export Initialize-*, Get-*Config, Test-* functions)?**

Default: No (allow modules to define their own interfaces based on functionality)

---

Please answer each question with:
- **yes** 
- **no**
- **idk** (I'll use the default)

After receiving all 5 answers, I'll proceed to Phase 2 with detailed technical questions based on your responses.
