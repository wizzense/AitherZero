# Phase 1: Discovery Questions

Based on your requirements for AI tools integration, configuration management, and orchestration, I need to understand some key aspects of your vision. Please answer with **yes**, **no**, or **idk** (I'll use the default).

## Question 1: AI Tool Installation Preference
**Should the setup wizard offer different installation profiles (e.g., "minimal", "developer", "full") where only the "developer" and "full" profiles include AI tools?**

Default: **yes** (provide installation profiles for different use cases)

---

## Question 2: Configuration Repository Structure
**Should the configuration repository support multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) with separate configuration sets for each?**

Default: **yes** (enable multi-environment configuration management)

---

## Question 3: Claude Commands Scope
**Should destructive operations in Claude commands use context-aware confirmation (e.g., always confirm for production, skip confirmation for dev environments)?**

Default: **yes** (implement smart confirmation based on context/environment)

---

## Question 4: Orchestration Complexity
**Should the orchestration playbooks support conditional logic and branching (if-then-else) beyond simple sequential execution?**

Default: **yes** (enable advanced orchestration patterns)

---

## Question 5: Configuration Migration
**Should the system automatically detect and migrate existing local configurations when users switch to a custom configuration repository?**

Default: **yes** (provide automatic migration assistance)

Please provide your answers to all 5 questions before we proceed to Phase 2.
