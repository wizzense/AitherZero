  - Web enrollment configuration
  - OCSP responder setup
  - Security auditing enablement
  - Post-installation verification

### Integration Features

#### AitherZero Framework Integration
- **Logging**: All functions use `Write-CustomLog` for centralized logging
- **Error Handling**: Standardized try/catch patterns with detailed error messages
- **Path Handling**: Cross-platform compatible using `Join-Path`
- **Module Loading**: Follows AitherZero's modular architecture patterns

#### Security Best Practices
- **Parameter Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and security ranges
- **ShouldProcess Support**: All modification functions support `-WhatIf` and `-Confirm`
- **Privilege Checking**: Administrator validation for security functions
- **Domain Requirements**: Appropriate domain membership validation

### Adapted from Original Scripts

Successfully adapted and enhanced functionality from:
- `/powershellsec/Day2-Hardening/ActiveDirectory/` - AD management and monitoring
- `/powershellsec/Day4-Admins/Custom_Password_Policies.ps1` - Password policy management
- `/powershellsec/Day5-IPsec/Firewall/Starter-Firewall-Configuration-for-Workstations.ps1` - Firewall automation
- `/powershellsec/Day3-PKI/Install-CertificateServices.ps1` - Certificate Services deployment

### Security Enhancements Made

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed error logging with context
- Graceful degradation for optional features
- Comprehensive validation before making changes

#### Improved Functionality
- Added report generation capabilities
- Enhanced parameter validation
- Cross-platform compatibility where applicable
- Integration with existing AitherZero modules

#### Security Hardening
- Reduced attack surface through validation
- Secure defaults for all configurations
- Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Administrator privilege verification

## Repository Security

### Privacy Protection
- Added `powershellsec/` to `.gitignore` 
- Original scripts remain private and uncommitted
- Only adapted, cleaned code included in module
- No sensitive information exposed

### Code Quality
- All functions follow PowerShell best practices
- Comprehensive help documentation
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Security-focused parameter validation

## Next Steps for Enhancement

### Additional Functions Ready for Implementation
1. **Enable-ADSmartCardLogon** - Smart card authentication setup
2. **Get-ADDelegationRisks** - Advanced delegation analysis
3. **New-CertificateTemplate** - Certificate template management
4. **Enable-CertificateAutoEnrollment** - Auto-enrollment configuration
5. **Set-IPsecPolicy** - Zero-trust networking policies
6. **Enable-PowerShellRemotingSSL** - Secure remoting configuration
7. **New-JEAEndpoint** - Just Enough Administration setup

### Framework Integration Opportunities
- **SystemMonitoring Integration**: Security metrics and alerting
- **RemoteConnection Enhancement**: Secure remote access validation
- **PatchManager Integration**: Security configuration as code
- **TestingFramework**: Automated security validation tests
