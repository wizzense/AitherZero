**Total Removed**: **8 legacy workflow files**

## 🧠 **Workflow 1: intelligent-ci.yml**

### **Purpose**
Primary CI/CD pipeline with intelligent job execution based on change detection.

### **Key Features Implemented**
- **Smart Change Detection**: Skip unnecessary jobs based on file changes
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Windows, Linux, macOS with PowerShell 7 standardization
- **Consolidated Security**: Unified PSScriptAnalyzer + dependency scanning
- **Automated Failure Tracking**: Summary issue creation for build failures
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multi-platform test execution and coverage analysis

### **Job Architecture** (7 jobs)
1. **🔍 change-detection** - Analyze changed files and set execution flags
2. **🛠️ setup-environment** - Install PowerShell 7 across platforms
3. **🔒 security-analysis** - Consolidated security scanning
4. **🧪 cross-platform-tests** - Run tests across all platforms
5. **📊 code-coverage-analysis** - Unified coverage reporting
6. **🔨 build-validation** - Quick build validation
7. **📋 failure-summary** - Create summary issues for failures

### **Smart Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  push: [main, develop]
  pull_request: [main, develop]
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual with force_full_run option
```

## 📦 **Workflow 2: build-release.yml**

### **Purpose**
Simplified package building and release management with multi-profile support.

### **Key Features Implemented**
- **Multi-Profile Builds**: minimal, standard, full profiles
- **Cross-Platform Packages**: Windows (.zip), Linux/macOS (.tar.gz)
- **Automated Release Creation**: GitHub releases with organized assets
- **Build Validation**: Package integrity checks
- **Streamlined Matrix**: 9 combinations (3 platforms × 3 profiles)

### **Job Architecture** (2 jobs)
1. **🔨 build-matrix** - Generate build artifacts for all combinations
2. **🚀 create-release** - Create GitHub release with all artifacts

### **Smart Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']  # Version tags only
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual with profile selection
```

## 📚 **Workflow 3: documentation.yml**

### **Purpose**
Specialized workflow for documentation generation and repository synchronization.

### **Key Features Implemented**
- **API Documentation Generation**: Auto-generated PowerShell module docs
- **Repository Synchronization**: Automated sync to AitherLabs
- **Documentation Change Detection**: Skip when no docs changed
- **Automated Commits**: Auto-commit documentation updates with [skip ci]

### **Job Architecture** (4 jobs)
1. **🔍 change-detection** - Documentation-specific change analysis
2. **📖 api-documentation** - Generate PowerShell API documentation
3. **🔄 sync-repositories** - Repository synchronization
4. **📋 documentation-summary** - Pipeline execution summary

### **Smart Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths: ['**/*.md', 'docs/**', 'aither-core/**/*.ps1']
  schedule: # Daily at 6 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual with force options
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **PowerShell 7 Standardization**
- **Windows**: Uses latest PowerShell 7 by default
- **Linux**: Automatic installation via wget + dpkg
- **macOS**: Automatic installation via Homebrew
- **Validation**: Version checks ensure PowerShell 7+ across all platforms

### **Smart Change Detection**
```yaml
# Comprehensive file filters
filters: |
  code: ['**/*.ps1', '**/*.psm1', '**/*.psd1', 'aither-core/**']
  tests: ['tests/**', '**/*.Tests.ps1']
  docs: ['**/*.md', 'docs/**']
  config: ['configs/**', '.github/workflows/**']
  security: ['aither-core/modules/SecureCredentials/**']
```

### **Security Consolidation**
- **PSScriptAnalyzer**: Comprehensive PowerShell code analysis
- **NPM Audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanning
- **SARIF Reports**: Security analysis results format
- **Fail-Fast**: Critical security issues halt the pipeline

### **Failure Summary System**
- **Issue Creation**: Automated GitHub issues for pipeline failures
- **Deduplication**: Prevents issue spam with 24-hour windows
- **Rich Context**: Detailed failure information with links
- **Team Notification**: High-priority labels for team awareness
