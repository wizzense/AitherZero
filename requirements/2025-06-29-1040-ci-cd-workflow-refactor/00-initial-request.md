# Initial Request: CI/CD Workflow Refactor

**Date**: 2025-06-29 10:40
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Large

## User Request

> time to do a full review and complete refactor of our ci/cd workflows in github actions... we hvae like 36 tasks and it's a confusing mess. i want a single unified pipeline what intelligently handles all of our desired tasks without making a mess of running jobs that are almost impossible to keep track of.

## Current State Analysis

**Problem**: The project currently has **8 GitHub Actions workflows** with significant overlap, redundancy, and complexity:

### Workflow Inventory
1. `api-documentation.yml` - API doc generation
2. `build-release-simple.yml.disabled` - **DISABLED** simple build
3. `build-release.yml` - Complex multi-platform packaging (738 lines)
4. `ci-cd.yml` - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline (626 lines)
5. `code-coverage.yml` - Code coverage analysis
6. `parallel-ci-optimized.yml` - Optimized parallel CI (789 lines)
7. `sync-to-aitherlab.yml` - Repository synchronization
8. `test-coverage-enhanced.yml` - Enhanced test coverage

### Key Problems Identified
- **Massive Redundancy**: 5 different testing/CI workflows doing similar things
- **Trigger Conflicts**: Multiple workflows triggered by same events
- **Resource Waste**: 15-25 concurrent jobs per PR, 30+ jobs per main branch push
- **Complexity Explosion**: Individual workflows are 600-800 lines each
- **Maintenance Nightmare**: Changes need coordination across 8 files

## Desired Outcome

**Single unified intelligent pipeline** that:
- Consolidates all 8 workflows into a manageable system
- Eliminates redundancy and conflicts
- Provides intelligent job scheduling
- Maintains all current functionality
- Is easy to track and maintain
- Reduces GitHub Actions resource usage

## Success Criteria

1. **Consolidation**: Reduce 8 workflows to 2-3 focused workflows
2. **Intelligence**: Smart change detection and adaptive testing
3. **Clarity**: Easy to understand job flow and status
4. **Efficiency**: Reduce concurrent job count by 60%+
5. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for CI/CD logic
