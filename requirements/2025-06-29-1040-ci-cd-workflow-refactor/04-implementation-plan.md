- [ ] Disable old `ci-cd.yml` (replaced by intelligent-ci.yml)
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours - validate all features working

#### Day 5-7: Final Migration

**Priority 3 - Specialized Workflows:**
- [ ] Replace `api-documentation.yml` with documentation.yml
- [ ] Replace `sync-to-aitherlab.yml` functionality
- [ ] Replace `build-release.yml` with simplified version
- [ ] Full system validation and monitoring

## Phase 4: Cleanup Legacy (Week 4)

### File Removal Strategy
**Approach**: Systematic deletion with proper documentation

#### Day 1: Delete Disabled Workflows

**Immediate Deletion:**
```bash
# Remove already disabled file
rm .github/workflows/build-release-simple.yml.disabled

# Remove redundant coverage workflows
rm .github/workflows/code-coverage.yml
rm .github/workflows/test-coverage-enhanced.yml
```

**Documentation Tasks:**
- [ ] Document removed workflows in CHANGELOG.md

#### Day 2-3: Remove Complex Legacy Workflows

**Systematic Removal:**
```bash
# Remove complex overlapping workflows
rm .github/workflows/parallel-ci-optimized.yml
rm .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

# Rename old build workflow for reference
mv .github/workflows/build-release.yml .github/workflows/build-release.yml.legacy
```

**Backup Strategy:**
- [ ] Create `legacy-workflows` branch with all original files
- [ ] Tag current state before deletion as `pre-workflow-refactor`
- [ ] Document rollback procedures if needed

#### Day 4: Replace Specialized Workflows

**Final Replacements:**
```bash
# Remove original specialized workflows
rm .github/workflows/api-documentation.yml
rm .github/workflows/sync-to-aitherlab.yml

# Remove legacy build workflow
rm .github/workflows/build-release.yml.legacy
```

#### Day 5-7: Cleanup and Validation

**Final Cleanup Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove unused workflow scripts and dependencies
- [ ] Update VS Code tasks.json references
- [ ] Clean up workflow-related documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new workflow commands
- [ ] Validate all repository functionality

### Updated Repository Structure

**Final Workflow State:**

# Final verification
ls -la .github/workflows/
```
