# Phase 1: Discovery Questions

**Requirement**: CI/CD Workflow Refactor
**Phase**: Discovery Questions (1/5)
**Status**: In Progress

## Question 1 of 5 ✅

**Should the unified pipeline preserve all existing security scanning capabilities (SAST, dependency scanning, code quality checks)?**

**Answer**: YES

**Context**: Current workflows include various security features across multiple files. A unified pipeline could consolidate these into a single comprehensive security stage.

---

## Question 2 of 5 ✅

**Should the unified pipeline maintain cross-platform testing (Windows, Linux, macOS) or focus on a primary platform to reduce complexity?**

**Answer**: YES - Cross-platform with PowerShell 7 standardization

**Details**: Cross-platform testing should continue but standardized on PowerShell 7 latest only. Workflows should handle pwsh 7 dependency installation automatically.

**Context**: This reduces matrix complexity from 6+ jobs (3 platforms × 2+ PowerShell versions) to 3 jobs (3 platforms × 1 PowerShell version).

---

## Question 3 of 5 ✅

**Should the unified pipeline implement intelligent change detection to skip unnecessary jobs when only documentation or non-code files are modified?**

**Answer**: YES

**Context**: Current `parallel-ci-optimized.yml` has sophisticated change detection logic. This could reduce pipeline execution time by 70%+ for documentation-only changes.

---

## Question 4 of 5 ✅

**Should the unified pipeline maintain the current multi-profile package building (minimal/standard/full) or simplify to a single package type?**

**Answer**: YES

**Context**: Current `build-release.yml` creates 9 build combinations (3 platforms × 3 profiles). This adds significant complexity but provides installation flexibility.

---

## Question 5 of 5 ✅

**Should the unified pipeline include automatic PR creation and issue tracking integration for failed builds, or keep build status reporting simple?**

**Answer**: YES - Summary issue creation only (no PRs)

**Details**: Pipeline should create summary issues for errors/failures but NOT individual issues for each PowerShell linting warning or syntax error. No automatic PR creation.

**Context**: This provides failure tracking without issue spam, focusing on actionable build failures rather than individual code quality warnings.
