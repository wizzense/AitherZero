# Phase 1: Context Discovery Questions

**Status:** In Progress  
**Questions Answered:** 0/5  
**Format:** Yes/No questions with intelligent defaults

## Question 1 of 5

Based on the analysis of your existing OpenTofuProvider module, it currently supports Taliesins Hyper-V provider with enterprise security features. 

**Should the new abstraction layer extend the existing OpenTofuProvider module rather than creating a completely separate system?**

- **Yes** (Recommended): Build upon existing security model, credential management, and Hyper-V integration
- **No**: Create entirely new module with fresh architecture

**Intelligent Default:** Yes - Leverage existing enterprise-grade security and proven Hyper-V integration

**Your Answer:** Yes ✅

**Additional Note:** Include deployment scripts in aither-core in addition to the module.

## Question 2 of 5

Your existing system has template export/import capabilities with basic YAML/JSON configuration. For the remote repository integration you described:

**Should the abstraction layer include a template versioning and dependency management system to handle complex infrastructure relationships between different repository templates?**

- **Yes** (Recommended): Add versioning, dependencies, and template inheritance for complex multi-repo scenarios
- **No**: Keep simple template system focused on basic import/export

**Intelligent Default:** Yes - Complex infrastructure deployments benefit from dependency management and versioning

**Your Answer:** Yes ✅

## Question 3 of 5

Your current system focuses on Taliesins Hyper-V provider with Windows Server deployments. Given your emphasis on "ease of use and automation":

**Should the abstraction layer include support for multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, VMware vSphere) in addition to Hyper-V, or focus exclusively on perfecting the Hyper-V/Windows Server experience first?**

- **Yes** (Multi-cloud): Support multiple providers for broader infrastructure flexibility
- **No** (Recommended): Focus on perfecting Hyper-V/Windows Server integration before expanding

**Intelligent Default:** No - Perfect the core Hyper-V/Windows Server experience first, then expand

**Your Answer:** No ✅

**Additional Note:** Focus on perfecting Hyper-V on Windows Server Core first, then add support for other providers later.

## Question 4 of 5

Your existing ISOManager and ISOCustomizer modules handle ISO downloads and customization. For the infrastructure deployment workflow:

**Should the abstraction layer automatically trigger ISO preparation and customization as part of the infrastructure deployment process, or keep ISO management as a separate manual step?**

- **Yes** (Recommended): Automatic ISO handling integrated into deployment workflow for full automation
- **No**: Keep ISO management separate for more granular control

**Intelligent Default:** Yes - Full automation aligns with your "ease of use and automation" goals

**Your Answer:** Yes ✅

**Additional Note:** If expected ISOs and configurations already exist or are made aware of via configuration file, use existing resources. Include option to update ISOs (like new patched version of Server 2025) and offer to customize - this should all be automatable.

## Question 5 of 5

Your current system has PatchManager for Git operations and template export capabilities. For the remote repository workflow you described:

**Should the abstraction layer include automatic synchronization and caching of remote infrastructure repositories to enable offline deployments and faster subsequent deployments?**

- **Yes** (Recommended): Cache remote repos locally for offline capability and performance
- **No**: Always fetch from remote repositories for latest versions

**Intelligent Default:** Yes - Local caching improves reliability and deployment speed

**Your Answer:** Yes ✅
