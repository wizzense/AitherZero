# Initial Request: OpenTofu Infrastructure Abstraction Layer

**Timestamp:** 2025-06-28 22:50
**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** High

## Request Description

Plan and implement the OpenTofu abstraction, focusing on deployment on Windows Server and Hyper-V with Tailscale provider. AitherCore provides a lot of capabilities to setup the OpenTofu basics and I have example infrastructure in place. 

Ideally, a user will provide a remote repo with their preferred infrastructure, probably based on a template repo we provide, and that infrastructure and configuration files will be ingested by AitherCore to build, also allowing for easily switching repos for different types of deployments. 

The key is ease of use and automation. The ISOConfiguration and ISOCustomizer modules are important here because the infrastructure will require ISOs and build files.

## Key Requirements Identified

### Core Functionality
- **Remote Repository Integration**: Ingest infrastructure configs from user-provided remote repos
- **Template Repository System**: Provide base templates for common deployment patterns
- **Repository Switching**: Easy switching between different infrastructure repos for different deployment types
- **Windows Server Focus**: Primary target is Windows Server deployments
- **Hyper-V Integration**: Native Hyper-V provider support
- **Tailscale Provider**: Integration with Tailscale for networking

### Integration Points
- **OpenTofuProvider Module**: Leverage existing OpenTofu capabilities in AitherCore
- **ISOManager Module**: Handle ISO file management and preparation
- **ISOCustomizer Module**: Customize ISOs for specific deployment needs
- **Build File Management**: Handle various build artifacts and configuration files

### User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use**: Minimal configuration required from users
- **Automation**: Automated ingestion, processing, and deployment
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple infrastructure patterns and deployment types
- **Template-Based**: Reusable templates for common scenarios

## Existing Infrastructure
- AitherCore has OpenTofu basics already implemented
- Example infrastructure is available for reference
- ISOConfiguration and ISOCustomizer modules exist and are relevant

## Success Criteria
1. Users can specify a remote repository containing their infrastructure as code
2. AitherCore can automatically ingest and process the infrastructure configuration
3. Seamless switching between different infrastructure repositories
4. Successful deployment to Windows Server environments using Hyper-V
5. Integration with Tailscale provider for networking configuration
6. Automated ISO preparation and customization as needed
