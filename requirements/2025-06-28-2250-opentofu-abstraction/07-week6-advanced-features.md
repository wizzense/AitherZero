# Week 6: Advanced Features - Drift Detection and Rollback

## Overview
Implement advanced infrastructure management features including drift detection, rollback capabilities, state validation, and deployment automation. These features enhance the reliability and maintainability of infrastructure deployments.

## Goals
1. Detect infrastructure drift from desired state
2. Provide rollback capabilities for failed or problematic deployments
3. Implement state comparison and validation
4. Add deployment history and versioning
5. Create automated backup and restore functionality
6. Implement deployment validation hooks
7. Add deployment scheduling capabilities

## Architecture Design

### Drift Detection System
```powershell
# Drift detection workflow
Test-InfrastructureDrift -DeploymentId "abc123"
Get-DriftReport -DeploymentId "abc123" -Format "HTML"
Repair-InfrastructureDrift -DeploymentId "abc123" -AutoApprove
```

### Rollback System
```powershell
# Rollback capabilities
New-DeploymentSnapshot -DeploymentId "abc123" -Name "pre-update"
Restore-DeploymentSnapshot -DeploymentId "abc123" -SnapshotName "pre-update"
Start-DeploymentRollback -DeploymentId "abc123" -TargetVersion "1.2.0"
```

### State Management
```powershell
# State comparison and validation
Compare-DeploymentState -SourceId "abc123" -TargetId "def456"
Test-DeploymentState -DeploymentId "abc123" -ValidateResources
Export-DeploymentState -DeploymentId "abc123" -Format "JSON"
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Drift Detection
1. Implement infrastructure state scanning
2. Create drift comparison engine
3. Build drift reporting system

### Phase 2: Rollback System
1. Create deployment snapshots
2. Implement rollback orchestration
3. Add version-based rollback

### Phase 3: State Management
1. Build state comparison tools
2. Implement state validation
3. Create state export/import

### Phase 4: Automation Features
1. Add deployment scheduling
2. Implement validation hooks
3. Create automated workflows

## Benefits
- **Reliability**: Detect and correct infrastructure drift
- **Safety**: Rollback failed deployments quickly
- **Compliance**: Validate infrastructure against policies
- **Automation**: Schedule and automate deployment tasks
- **Visibility**: Comprehensive deployment history and reporting
