# Discovery Questions - Quickstart Validation

## Phase 1: Context Discovery Questions

Based on the analysis of AitherZero's codebase, I need to understand the scope and focus of the quickstart validation. Please answer these 5 yes/no questions:

### Question 1/5: Package Download Validation ✅

**Should we validate the complete package creation and download process (including building lean deployment packages for different platforms)?**

*Context: AitherZero has both a development repository and creates lean application packages for end users. This would test the build/package system.*

- YES = Test the full Build-Package.ps1 → package creation → download simulation workflow
- NO = Focus on validating the existing codebase without package creation testing

**Default if unknown:** YES - Package validation ensures end-users get working deployments

**ANSWER:** YES

*Additional context: User clarified that AitherZero will be the downstream/community version with basic homelab infrastructure features, while AitherLabs (private) and Aitherium (enterprise) contain advanced CI/CD automation and AI development integration.*

### Question 2/5: Repository Fork Chain Validation ✅

**Should we validate the dynamic repository detection system that works across the fork chain (AitherZero → AitherLabs → Aitherium)?**

*Context: The codebase includes dynamic repository detection (`Get-GitRepositoryInfo`) that adapts based on which repo it's running in. This ensures features work correctly regardless of which fork users are working with.*

- YES = Test repository detection, branch handling, and feature availability across different repo contexts
- NO = Focus validation on AitherZero-specific features only

**Default if unknown:** YES - Fork chain compatibility is essential for the tiered product strategy

**ANSWER:** YES

### Question 3/5: Cross-Platform Deployment Testing ✅

**Should we validate the cross-platform deployment capabilities (Windows, Linux, macOS) including PowerShell version compatibility (5.1 to 7.x)?**

*Context: AitherZero includes sophisticated cross-platform launchers, PowerShell version detection, and platform-specific adaptations. This would test the full compatibility matrix.*

- YES = Test deployment on multiple platforms and PowerShell versions with automated compatibility validation
- NO = Focus on single-platform validation (likely Windows with PowerShell 7)

**Default if unknown:** YES - Cross-platform support is a key differentiator for homelab users

**ANSWER:** YES

### Question 4/5: Infrastructure Automation Validation ✅

**Should we validate the core infrastructure automation capabilities (OpenTofu/Terraform, Hyper-V provider, lab deployment scenarios)?**

*Context: AitherZero's primary value proposition is infrastructure-as-code for homelabs. This includes the OpenTofu abstraction layer, Hyper-V integration, and automated lab deployment workflows that were recently implemented.*

- YES = Test the full infrastructure automation stack including OpenTofu, Hyper-V provider, and lab scenarios
- NO = Focus on basic application functionality without infrastructure automation testing

**Default if unknown:** YES - Infrastructure automation is the core value proposition for homelab users

**ANSWER:** YES

---

### Question 5/5: Bulletproof Validation Integration ✅

**Should we validate and potentially enhance the existing Bulletproof Validation system (Quick/Standard/Complete testing levels) to ensure it properly validates the quickstart experience?**

*Context: AitherZero already has a sophisticated 3-tier validation system (30s/2-5m/10-15m). We could leverage and enhance this existing system rather than creating separate quickstart validation.*

- YES = Enhance the existing Bulletproof Validation system to include quickstart-specific tests and ensure it validates the complete user experience
- NO = Create separate quickstart validation scripts independent of the existing testing framework

**Default if unknown:** YES - Leveraging existing testing infrastructure is more efficient and maintainable

**ANSWER:** YES
