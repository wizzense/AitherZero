## Question 1: Configuration UI Integration

**Should the configuration management interface be integrated directly into the startup flow (before module selection)?**

Context: Currently, configuration is loaded from JSON files without user visibility. This would add a step to view/edit configuration before proceeding.

Default: **yes** - Users should see and modify configuration as part of the startup process

Your answer: _______________

## Question 2: Module Discovery Display

**Should all available module functions be automatically discovered and displayed during startup (not just the pre-selected scripts)?**

Context: Many module functions are currently hidden from users. This would scan all modules and present their capabilities.

Default: **yes** - Show all available module functions for better discoverability

Your answer: _______________

## Question 3: Configuration Persistence

**Should configuration changes made during startup be automatically saved as named profiles for future use?**

## Question 4: Terminal UI Enhancement

**Should the startup experience use a rich terminal UI with menus and navigation (versus simple text prompts)?**

Context: This would provide a more modern experience with arrow key navigation, search, and visual feedback.

Default: **no** - Keep the simple text-based interface for maximum compatibility

Your answer: _______________

## Question 5: Module Preloading

**Should frequently used modules be preloaded during startup to improve performance (at the cost of initial startup time)?**

Context: This would make module functions immediately available but increase the initial startup time.

Default: **no** - Load modules on-demand to keep startup fast
