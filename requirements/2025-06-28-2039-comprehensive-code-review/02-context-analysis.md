- **Required**: Measurable SLAs with monitoring and alerting
- **Impact**: Essential for production service guarantees

#### 3. Security & Compliance Gap
- **Current**: Security features implemented but not formally documented
- **Required**: Comprehensive security policies, compliance frameworks
- **Impact**: Mandatory for enterprise security audits

#### 4. Development Process Gap
- **Current**: Excellent development practices but informally documented
- **Required**: Formal SDLC requirements, release management procedures
- **Impact**: Needed for team scaling and process standardization

#### 5. Integration Standards Gap
- **Current**: Successful integrations with various tools
- **Required**: Formal integration requirements and certification processes
- **Impact**: Critical for ecosystem growth and partner integrations
