# Discovery Questions - Phase 1

**Date:** 2025-06-28 20:39 UTC
**Requirement ID:** 2025-06-28-2039-comprehensive-code-review
**Phase:** Context Discovery Questions (1/5)

## Question 1 of 5

Based on the analysis of your mature v1.0.0 AitherZero framework with 14+ modules, comprehensive testing, and MCP integration:

**Should the formal requirements documentation include detailed API specifications for all 14 PowerShell modules to support enterprise adoption and third-party integrations?**

This would involve creating formal interface documentation for modules like LabRunner (26 functions), PatchManager (8 core functions), OpenTofuProvider, DevEnvironment, and others - defining input parameters, return values, error conditions, and usage patterns.

**Default recommendation:** Yes - Enterprise adoption typically requires formal API documentation

**Your answer:** Yes

## Question 2 of 5

Given your sophisticated 3-tier testing framework (Quick/Standard/Complete validation) and cross-platform support:

**Should formal performance requirements and SLAs be established for all major operations (startup time <3s, module loading <2s, validation times)?**

This would create measurable performance benchmarks for the framework's core operations, testing procedures, and establish performance regression testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

**Default recommendation:** Yes - Production frameworks need formal performance guarantees

**Your answer:** Yes

## Question 3 of 5

Considering your extensive AI integration (MCP server, Claude Code support, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) and enterprise-grade security features:

**Should formal security and compliance requirements be established covering data handling, credential management, and AI tool integrations?**

This would include security policies for the SecureCredentials module, data privacy requirements for AI integrations, and compliance frameworks for enterprise deployment scenarios.

**Default recommendation:** Yes - Enterprise deployments require formal security documentation

**Your answer:** Yes

## Question 4 of 5

With your mature PatchManager v2.0 workflow, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and multi-repository support:

**Should formal development lifecycle and release management requirements be established covering branching strategy, testing gates, and deployment procedures?**

This would formalize your current development practices including the PatchManager workflow, bulletproof validation requirements, and multi-repository synchronization processes into official documented requirements.

**Default recommendation:** Yes - Mature frameworks benefit from formalized development processes

**Your answer:** Yes

## Question 5 of 5

Given your comprehensive infrastructure automation capabilities (OpenTofu/Terraform, 40+ automation scripts, HyperV integration):

**Should formal integration and interoperability requirements be established for third-party tools, cloud platforms, and infrastructure providers?**

This would define standard integration patterns, supported platforms, certification requirements for new integrations, and compatibility matrices for the ecosystem of tools AitherZero works with.

**Default recommendation:** Yes - Infrastructure frameworks need clear integration standards

**Your answer:** Yes
