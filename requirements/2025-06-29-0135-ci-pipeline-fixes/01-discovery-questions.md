# Discovery Questions - CI/CD Pipeline Fixes

**Phase 1: Context Discovery**  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Question 1 of 5

**PowerShell Version Compatibility Focus**

Should we prioritize fixing the ForEach-Object -Parallel compatibility issues that are causing the Windows linting pipeline to fail?

The error suggests PowerShell version compatibility problems with parallel processing in the CI environment. This could involve:
- Updating PowerShell requirements in CI
- Replacing parallel constructs with compatible alternatives
- Adding version detection and fallback logic

**Default:** YES - Fix parallel processing compatibility for CI stability

**Your answer:** YES

## Question 2 of 5

**Pester Test Infrastructure Modernization**

Should we update the existing Pester test infrastructure to be compatible with the new quickstart validation system and modern CI/CD requirements?

This could include:
- Updating Pester configuration files
- Fixing test isolation issues
- Resolving conflicts between old and new test suites
- Standardizing test output formats for CI

**Default:** YES - Modernize Pester infrastructure for better CI integration

**Your answer:** YES

## Question 3 of 5

**GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization**

Should we optimize the GitHub Actions workflows to handle the increased test complexity and ensure reliable execution across different runner environments?

This could include:
- Updating PowerShell version requirements in workflows
- Adding proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Optimizing parallel job execution
- Adding environment-specific configurations for Windows/Linux/macOS

**Default:** YES - Optimize workflows for reliability and performance

**Your answer:** YES

## Question 4 of 5

**Test Execution Strategy Enhancement**

Should we implement a tiered test execution strategy that separates fast unit tests from slower integration tests to improve CI pipeline performance and reliability?

This could include:
- Running lightweight tests first for fast feedback
- Separating package validation tests from core functionality tests
- Adding conditional test execution based on changed files
- Implementing proper test categorization and tagging

**Default:** YES - Implement tiered testing for better CI performance

**Your answer:** YES

## Question 5 of 5

**Comprehensive Error Reporting and Debugging**

Should we enhance error reporting and debugging capabilities in the CI pipeline to make it easier to diagnose and fix test failures quickly?

This could include:
- Adding detailed error logging with stack traces
- Implementing test artifact collection (logs, reports, coverage)
- Adding notification systems for critical failures
- Creating debugging guides for common CI issues

**Default:** YES - Enhance debugging and error reporting for faster issue resolution

**Your answer:** YES
