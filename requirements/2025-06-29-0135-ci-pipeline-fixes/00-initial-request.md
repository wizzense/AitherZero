# Initial Request - CI/CD Pipeline Failures

**Date:** 2025-06-29 01:35:00 UTC  
**Type:** Bugfix  
**Priority:** High  

## Problem Description

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is experiencing failures in two key areas:

### 1. Pester Test Failures
- Many Pester tests are failing in the pipeline
- This affects code quality validation and release confidence

### 2. PowerShell Linting Issues (Windows-latest)
- Lint job failed in 16 seconds on windows-latest runner
- Error occurs in PowerShell analysis with ForEach-Object -Parallel
- Specific error: "The pipeline has been stopped" at line 15

## Error Details

```

     |    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     | The pipeline has been stopped.

```

## Impact

- CI/CD pipeline failures block merges and releases
- Reduced confidence in code quality
- Potential issues with new quickstart validation system
- Development workflow disruption

## Context

This issue appears after implementing the comprehensive quickstart validation system, suggesting potential conflicts or integration issues with existing test infrastructure.
