# Discovery Questions - Phase 1

**Requirement:** CI/CD Linting Pipeline Fix  
**Date:** 2025-06-29 01:00 UTC  
**Phase:** Discovery Questions (1/4)

## Question 1 of 5

**Is this error occurring consistently across all CI/CD runs, or is it intermittent?**

*This helps determine if it's a systemic issue with the PowerShell parallel processing code or an environmental/timing issue.*

**Default if unknown:** YES - Consistent failure  
*(Pipeline errors that block development are typically consistent and need immediate systematic fixes)*

---

**Context:** The failing code `$jobs = $scriptFiles | ForEach-Object -Parallel {` suggests a PowerShell version compatibility issue, as `ForEach-Object -Parallel` was introduced in PowerShell 7.0. GitHub Actions Windows runners may be using different PowerShell versions.

**Answer:** YES ✅

---

## Question 2 of 5

**Should the fix maintain PowerShell 7+ parallel processing capabilities when available, with fallback for older versions?**

*This determines whether to implement version detection and conditional parallel processing, or simplify to sequential processing for maximum compatibility.*

**Default if unknown:** YES - Maintain performance benefits  
*(PowerShell 7+ parallel processing provides significant performance improvements for linting large codebases, so fallback approach is preferred over complete removal)*

**Context:** Since the error is consistent, it's likely a PowerShell version incompatibility. We can implement version detection to use parallel processing on PowerShell 7+ and fall back to sequential processing on older versions.

**Answer:** YES ✅

## Question 3 of 5

**Should the CI/CD pipeline be updated to explicitly specify PowerShell 7+ for consistency across all platforms?**

*This determines whether to update the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure consistent PowerShell versions across Windows, Linux, and macOS runners.*

**Default if unknown:** YES - Ensure consistency  
*(Explicit PowerShell version specification prevents environment-dependent failures and ensures predictable behavior across all CI/CD platforms)*

**Context:** GitHub Actions runners may have different default PowerShell versions. Specifying PowerShell 7+ in the workflow ensures all platforms use the same version with parallel processing support.

**Answer:** YES ✅

## Question 4 of 5

**Should we implement enhanced error handling and logging in the linting scripts to better diagnose future CI/CD failures?**

*This determines whether to add comprehensive error handling, version detection logging, and failure diagnostics to prevent similar issues.*

**Default if unknown:** YES - Improve diagnostics  
*(Enhanced error handling and logging significantly reduces debugging time for CI/CD issues and provides better visibility into pipeline failures)*

**Context:** The current error provides minimal context. Adding version detection, detailed error messages, and execution environment logging will help prevent and diagnose future pipeline issues.

**Answer:** YES ✅

---

## Question 5 of 5

**Should we add automated testing for the CI/CD pipeline itself to catch linting script failures before they break the main workflow?**

*This determines whether to implement pipeline testing that validates linting scripts across different PowerShell versions and platforms before deployment.*

**Default if unknown:** YES - Prevent future failures  
*(Pipeline testing catches infrastructure issues early and prevents development workflow disruptions, especially important for critical CI/CD components)*

**Context:** A dedicated test suite for CI/CD scripts would validate PowerShell compatibility, parallel processing functionality, and cross-platform behavior before changes are merged to the main workflow.

**Answer:** YES ✅
