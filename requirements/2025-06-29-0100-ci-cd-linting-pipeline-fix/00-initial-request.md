# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-06-29 01:00 UTC  
**Requester:** User  
**Type:** CI/CD Pipeline Fix  

## Request Description

All platform CI/CD linting jobs fail. Specifically, the Lint (windows-latest) job failed 1 minute ago in 16s with the following error:

```
üîç Running optimized PowerShell analysis...
InvalidOperation: D:\a\_temp\b05a95d0-6dc3-4a65-9604-74f1c69780be.ps1:15
Line |
  15 |    $jobs = $scriptFiles | ForEach-Object -Parallel {
     |    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     | The pipeline has been stopped.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Error Analysis

**Error Type:** InvalidOperation  
**Location:** Line 15 in PowerShell temp script  
**Failing Code:** `$jobs = $scriptFiles | ForEach-Object -Parallel {`  
**Root Cause:** PowerShell parallel processing pipeline issue on Windows platform  
**Impact:** Blocking all CI/CD workflows and development processes

## Scope

- **Primary Issue:** PowerShell ForEach-Object -Parallel failure on Windows
- **Secondary Issues:** Potential cross-platform compatibility problems in linting scripts
- **Affected Systems:** GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, specifically Windows runners
- **Business Impact:** Development workflow blocked, code quality checks disabled

## Expected Outcome

- Fix the PowerShell parallel processing error
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for all linting scripts
- Restore CI/CD pipeline functionality
- Implement safeguards to prevent similar failures

## Technical Context

The error appears to be related to PowerShell parallel processing (`ForEach-Object -Parallel`) which may have different behavior or requirements across PowerShell versions or platforms. This suggests a need to review PowerShell version compatibility and potentially implement fallback mechanisms for older PowerShell versions or different execution environments.
