# Initial Request

## Request Description
Evaluate this one more time. This whole setup seems a bit convoluted at this point. Let's do this right. Please analyze and engineer an appropriate and user-friendly + automation friendly CLI interface that allows users (or AI agents) the ability to access the full power of the platform. Everything should work through the aither-core API as well so that basically, everything is automatable via custom scripts.

## Context
The user is experiencing issues with the current AitherZero quickstart process:
- Module loading errors
- Export-ModuleMember being called outside of module context
- Complex and convoluted setup process
- Poor user experience for first-time users

## Goals
1. Design a clean, intuitive CLI interface
2. Make everything automatable through a consistent API
3. Support both human users and AI agents
4. Simplify the quickstart experience
5. Fix the underlying architectural issues

## Current Problems Identified
- Export-ModuleMember error in aither-core.ps1
- Module dependency loading issues
- Complex entry point structure
- Inconsistent API patterns
- Poor error handling and user feedback
