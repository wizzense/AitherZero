# CI Pipeline Fixes Applied ✅

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Wrong File Path 🔧
- **Before**: CI looked for `./aither-core/core-runner.ps1` (doesn't exist)
- **After**: CI looks for `./aither-core/aither-core.ps1` (correct path)

### 2. Silent Failure Mode 🚨
- **Before**: `exit 0` when no build scripts found (misleading success)
- **After**: `exit 1` with error message when build scripts missing

### 3. Poor Debug Information 🔍
- **Before**: No visibility into what CI could see
- **After**: Shows directory contents, found scripts, and debug info

### 4. Build Release Issues 📦
- **Before**: Startup scripts referenced wrong file paths
- **After**: Windows/Linux startup scripts use correct `aither-core.ps1` path

## Expected CI Behavior Now

The CI should now correctly find **4 build scripts**:
- ✅ `./build/Build-Release.ps1`
- ✅ `./build/Quick-Build.ps1`
- ✅ `./build/Test-Release.ps1`
- ✅ `./aither-core/aither-core.ps1`

## Local Validation Confirmed

✅ All 4 scripts detected locally
✅ Syntax validation working
✅ Main script executes with -WhatIf successfully

## Next Steps

1. Monitor next CI run for "Build Test" job
2. Should see debug output showing found scripts
3. Build validation should pass on all platforms
4. Release builds should work when triggered
