## Executive Overview

This project proposes adding automated sheet music to MIDI conversion capabilities to the AitherZero infrastructure automation platform. Using cutting-edge AI vision recognition technology (Ollama), users will be able to convert guitar sheet music images directly into MIDI files through simple PowerShell commands.

### Business Value

**Target Users:**
- Musicians learning and practicing guitar
- Music educators creating digital content
- Content creators needing MIDI backing tracks
- Developers building music applications
- Students studying music theory

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Time Savings**: Convert sheet music in seconds vs. manual transcription (minutes/hours)
2. **Accessibility**: No special music software required - just images and AitherZero
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing AitherZero workflows
4. **Cost Effective**: Leverages free, open-source AI models (Ollama)
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Market Context

**Current Solutions:**
- Manual MIDI creation: Time-consuming, requires music notation software
- Commercial OCR software: Expensive ($200-500), limited flexibility
- Online services: Privacy concerns, subscription costs, internet required

**Our Advantage:**
- Free and open-source
- Runs locally (privacy-friendly)
- Integrated with automation platform
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Vision model accuracy | High | Medium | Multiple models, confidence scoring, iterative improvement |
| Platform compatibility | Medium | Low | Early cross-platform testing, Docker fallback |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Image optimization, caching, parallel processing |

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Phased Rollout**: Start with simple notation, iterate complexity
2. **Multiple Models**: Use fallback models for better accuracy
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test on all platforms early
4. **Clear Documentation**: Set user expectations appropriately
5. **Feedback Loop**: Gather user feedback for continuous improvement
