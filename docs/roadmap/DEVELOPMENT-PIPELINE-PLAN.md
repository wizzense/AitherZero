# ðŸ”„ Development Pipeline Implementation Plan

## **Repository Structure & Workflow**

### **Primary Development Flow:**
```
wizzense/opentofu-lab-automation.git (Your Personal Dev)
    â†“ (Development & Testing)
Aitherium/AitherLabs.git (Public Release)
    â†“ (Premium Features)
Aitherium/Aitherium.git (Premium Edition)
```

### **Pipeline Components:**

#### **1. Personal Development (wizzense/opentofu-lab-automation)**
- **Purpose**: Your private development workspace
- **Benefits**:
  - Full GitHub Copilot access
  - GitHub Codespaces support
  - Unrestricted experimentation
  - Private feature development

#### **2. Public Release (Aitherium/AitherLabs)**
- **Purpose**: Open-source community version
- **Features**: Core infrastructure automation
- **Content**: Stable, tested features ready for public use

#### **3. Premium Edition (Aitherium/Aitherium)**
- **Purpose**: Enterprise/Premium features

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Kicker-Git (Lightweight Bootstrap)**
- Modify `kicker-git.ps1` to download only `aither-core/` directory
- Add option for full project clone with dev environment setup
- Maintain backward compatibility with current functionality

### **Phase 2: Development Pipeline Scripts**
- Create repository synchronization scripts
- Implement feature promotion workflows
- Add automated testing between repositories

### **Phase 3: Environment-Specific Configurations**
- Personal development configuration
- Public release configuration
- Premium edition configuration
- Lab-specific configurations

## **Immediate Actions**

1. **Create Enhanced Kicker-Git Bootstrap**
2. **Add Full Development Environment Setup Option**
3. **Implement Repository Sync Workflows**
4. **Create Configuration Management System**

## **Benefits**

- **Development Flexibility**: Use personal repo with full Copilot access
- **Release Control**: Controlled promotion of features to public
- **Premium Strategy**: Clear separation of open vs premium features
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and promotion workflows
- **Security**: Private development with public release control
