# Workflow Status and Troubleshooting Guide

## Current State (as of latest commit 24779d6)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- All workflow YAML files are syntactically valid
- VERSION file: 1.0.0.0
- Module manifest: 1.0.0.0
- validate-config.yml YAML error fixed
- Redundant docker-publish.yml disabled

### üîß Recent Changes
1. Added QEMU emulation setup for ARM64 Docker builds
2. Enabled multi-platform builds: `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: ARM64 Build Failures (QEMU Emulation)

**Symptom:**
```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "/dev/.buildkit_qemu_emulator /bin/sh -c ..."
.buildkit_qemu_emulator: /bin/sh: Invalid ELF image for this architecture
```

**Root Cause:**
- QEMU emulation in GitHub Actions can be unreliable
- ARM64 builds take significantly longer (15-20 min vs 5-10 min)
- Emulation overhead can cause timeouts or failures

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Remove ARM64 Support (Recommended for Stability)
Build only for `linux/amd64`, which covers 95%+ of users:

```yaml
# In deploy-pr-environment.yml, change line 242 from:
platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64

# To:
platforms: linux/amd64
```

And remove QEMU setup (lines 228-231):
```yaml
# DELETE these lines:
- name: üîß Set up QEMU
  uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v3
  with:
    platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster builds (5-10 minutes instead of 15-20)
- More reliable (no QEMU emulation issues)
- Simpler troubleshooting
- Still covers Intel/AMD x86_64 processors

**Who it affects:**
- ARM users (M1/M2 Macs, Raspberry Pi) can still use Rosetta 2 or native builds
- Most Docker users are on amd64

#### Option B: Keep ARM64 but Add Retry Logic
Add retry and timeout handling:

```yaml
- name: üèóÔ∏è Build and Push Container
  id: build
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  timeout-minutes: 30  # Add explicit timeout
  continue-on-error: false
  with:
    # ... existing config ...
```

#### Option C: Use Native ARM64 Runners (Future)
- Requires self-hosted ARM64 runners or GitHub-hosted ARM runners
- More expensive but more reliable
- Not available in standard GitHub Actions

### Issue 2: Workflow Trigger Problems

**Check if workflows are triggering:**

1. Tag push should trigger both:
   - `release-automation.yml`
   - `deploy-pr-environment.yml`

2. Verify triggers in both files:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
```

### Issue 3: Permissions

Both workflows need:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write   # For release-automation
  packages: write   # For Docker push
  id-token: write   # For OIDC
```

### Issue 4: Container Registry Authentication

Check if GitHub token has package write permissions:
```yaml
- name: üîê Log in to GitHub Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io
    username: ${{ github.actor }}
    password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Must have packages:write
```

## Recommended Action Plan

### For Immediate Fix (Remove ARM64):

1. Edit `.github/workflows/deploy-pr-environment.yml`:
   - Line 228-231: Delete QEMU setup
   - Line 242: Change to `platforms: linux/amd64`

2. This will:
   - Make builds faster and more reliable
   - Still support 95%+ of Docker users
   - Eliminate QEMU emulation issues

### To Debug Current Failure:

1. Go to: https://github.com/wizzense/AitherZero/actions
2. Find the failing workflow run
3. Click on the failed job
4. Look for the specific error message
5. Common errors:
   - QEMU emulation failure ‚Üí Remove ARM64
   - Authentication failure ‚Üí Check token permissions
   - Timeout ‚Üí Increase timeout or remove ARM64
   - Rate limit ‚Üí Wait and retry

## Quick Test Command

To test locally (if you have Docker):
```bash
# Test amd64 only (fast)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t test:amd64 .

# Test multi-platform (slow, may fail)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t test:multi .
```

## What I Need to Help Further

Please provide:
1. The specific error message from the failing workflow
2. Link to the failed workflow run
3. Which approach you prefer:
   - Remove ARM64 support (recommended)
   - Keep ARM64 and debug
   - Skip Docker builds entirely

## Current Files Modified

```
.github/workflows/deploy-pr-environment.yml  (added QEMU + platforms)
.github/workflows/validate-config.yml        (fixed YAML syntax)
.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml         (disabled ‚Üí .disabled)
VERSION                                       (0.0.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0.0)
AitherZero.psd1                              (0.0.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0.0)
```

All changes are minimal and focused on fixing the release process.
