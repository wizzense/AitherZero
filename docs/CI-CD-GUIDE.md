     - Release Management
     - Dashboard Deployment

### 2. **Continuous Deployment** (`continuous-deployment.yml`)
   - **Trigger**: Successful CI/CD Pipeline
   - **Environments**:
     - Development (auto-deploy)
     - Staging (with smoke tests)
     - Production (with approval)
   - **Features**:
     - Blue-green deployments
     - Automatic rollback
     - Backup creation

     - Metrics collection
     - Report generation
     - Issue creation
     - Dashboard updates

## üìà Test Results & Reporting

### Accessing Reports

1. **GitHub Pages Dashboard**
   ```
   https://<username>.github.io/AitherZero/
   ```

2. **Direct Report Links**
   - Test Results: `/reports/latest/test-report.html`
   - Coverage: `/reports/latest/coverage-report.html`
   - Performance: `/reports/latest/performance-report.html`
   - Security: `/reports/latest/security-report.html`

3. **Artifacts**
   - Available in Actions tab
   - Retained for 30 days
   - Downloadable as ZIP

### Report Types

| Report | Frequency | Content |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Test Results | Every run | Pass/fail, duration, details |
| Code Coverage | Every run | Line/branch coverage |
| Performance | Every run | Benchmarks, thresholds |
| Security | Every run | Vulnerabilities, CVEs |
| Tech Debt | Weekly | Code quality metrics |
| Executive | Weekly | High-level summary |

## üéØ Quality Gates

### Required Checks
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Code coverage > 70%
- ‚úÖ No critical security issues
- ‚úÖ PSScriptAnalyzer passing
- ‚úÖ Performance within thresholds

### Branch Protection
```yaml
main:
  - Require PR reviews (2)
  - Require status checks
  - Require up-to-date branches
  - Include administrators

develop:
  - Require PR reviews (1)
  - Require status checks
  
feature/*:
  - No restrictions
```

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Environments

| Environment | URL | Auto-Deploy | Approval |
|------------|-----|-------------|----------|
| Development | dev.aitherzero.example.com | Yes | No |
| Staging | staging.aitherzero.example.com | After Dev | No |
| Production | aitherzero.example.com | After Staging | Yes |

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Deploy to inactive environment
   - Run health checks
   - Switch traffic
   - Monitor for issues
   - Rollback if needed

2. **Rollback Procedure**
   - Automatic on failure
   - Restores from backup
   - Notifies team
   - Creates incident issue

## üì¶ Release Management

### Versioning
- **Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE+BUILD`
- **Examples**:
  - Release: `1.2.3`
  - Pre-release: `1.2.3-rc.1`
  - Development: `1.2.3-dev.456+abc123`

### Release Process
1. Tag creation triggers release
2. Build and test
3. Generate release notes
4. Create GitHub release
5. Publish to PowerShell Gallery
6. Deploy to production

### Release Artifacts
- ZIP package (Windows)
- TAR.GZ package (Unix)
- SHA256 checksums
- Release notes
- API documentation

## üîî Notifications

### Channels
- **Slack**: Build status, deployments
- **Email**: Failures, weekly reports
- **GitHub Issues**: Weekly metrics
- **Dashboard**: Real-time status

### Configuration
Set these secrets/variables in GitHub:
```yaml
Secrets:
  - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
  - EMAIL_USERNAME
  - EMAIL_PASSWORD
  - PSGALLERY_API_KEY
  - AWS_ROLE_ARN_*

Variables:
  - EMAIL_RECIPIENTS
  - REPORT_RECIPIENTS
  - SLACK_CHANNEL
```

## üìä Metrics & KPIs

### Build Metrics
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Failure patterns
- Recovery time

### Code Metrics

- Complexity
- Duplication
- Technical debt

### Test Metrics
- Total tests
- Pass rate
- Coverage

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Testing

### Run CI/CD Locally
```powershell
# Install act for local GitHub Actions
./az.ps1 0441 -InstallDependencies

# Test specific workflow
act -W .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml

# Test with specific event
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml
```

### Generate Reports Locally
```powershell
# Run tests and generate reports
./Start-AitherZero.ps1 -Mode Orchestrate -Playbook test-full

# Publish results
./az.ps1 0450  # Publish test results

# View locally
Start-Process "./docs/reports/latest/test-report.html"
```

## üîí Security

### Secrets Management
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use OIDC for cloud providers
- Implement least privilege

### Scanning
- Trivy for container scanning
- OWASP dependency check
- PSScriptAnalyzer for code
- GitHub Advanced Security
