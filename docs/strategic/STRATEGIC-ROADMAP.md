## Resource Requirements

### Time Investment (Estimated)

**Immediate (Next 30 days)**
- Project management: 10-15 hours/week
- Development: 20-30 hours/week
- Documentation: 10-15 hours/week
- Community engagement: 5-10 hours/week

**Ongoing (Monthly)**

- Documentation hosting: GitHub Pages (free)

---

## Decision Framework

### Evaluating New Features

Use this framework to prioritize feature requests:

1. **User Impact**: How many users benefit? (1-5)
2. **Strategic Alignment**: Does it support distribution/adoption goals? (1-5)
3. **Implementation Effort**: Complexity and time required (1-5, inverse)
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Ongoing support needs (1-5, inverse)
5. **Community Interest**: Requested or upvoted features (1-5)

**Score = (User Impact + Strategic Alignment + Community Interest) √ó (Implementation Effort + Maintenance Burden) / 2**

Higher scores indicate higher priority.

---

## Conclusion

AitherZero has a solid foundation and significant potential for growth. The strategic focus should be:

1. **Expand distribution** to reach more users
2. **Build community** to sustain long-term growth
3. **Enhance capabilities** based on real user needs
4. **Improve experience** to reduce barriers to adoption

The recommended immediate actions balance quick wins (merging existing PRs, publishing to PSGallery) with foundation-building (community guidelines, documentation) and strategic investments (installer, showcase content).

**Next Step**: Review this roadmap with stakeholders and begin executing Week 1 actions.
