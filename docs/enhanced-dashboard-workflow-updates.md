# Enhanced Dashboard Workflow Updates

## Summary

The `.github/workflows/comprehensive-report.yml` workflow has been updated to support the new Enhanced Unified Dashboard with the following key improvements:

## Key Changes

### 1. **Multi-Branch Support**
- Added `branches` input parameter to analyze multiple branches in parallel
- Updated workflow triggers to include more branch patterns (`feature/**`, `develop`)
- Dynamic branch selection based on workflow trigger type (schedule vs manual)

### 2. **Enhanced Permissions**
- Added `issues: read` and `pull-requests: read` for GitHub API access
- Added `pages: write` and `id-token: write` for GitHub Pages deployment
- Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` as environment variable for API access

### 3. **New Report Type**
- Added `enhanced-dashboard` option to report types
- Added `enable_historical_analysis` input for trend analysis

### 4. **Updated Dashboard Generation**
- Replaced `Generate-ComprehensiveReport.ps1` with `Generate-EnhancedUnifiedDashboard.ps1`
- Added support for both single-file and GitHub Pages output formats
- Pass GitHub token for API access to fetch real-time data
- Create dashboard assets directory for resources

### 5. **Historical Data Management**
- Download and upload historical data artifacts with 365-day retention
- Enable trend analysis across workflow runs
- Store branch-specific historical data

### 6. **Enhanced GitHub Pages Deployment**
- Create structured directory layout (`/assets`, `/branches`)
- Deploy branch-specific dashboards to separate directories
- Generate enhanced index.html with branch navigation
- Use `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` for better deployment control
- Keep existing files to preserve historical reports

### 7. **Improved Artifact Collection**
- Include `dashboard-assets/**/*` in artifact upload
- Separate historical data artifacts by branch name
- Extended retention for historical data (365 days vs 90 days)

### 8. **Enhanced Workflow Summary**
- Display analyzed branches and health metrics
- Include links to GitHub Pages dashboard
- Show feature list of the enhanced dashboard

## Usage Examples

### Manual Trigger with Multiple Branches
```bash
gh workflow run comprehensive-report.yml \
  -f branches="main,develop,feature/xyz" \
  -f report_type="enhanced-dashboard" \
  -f enable_historical_analysis=true
```

### Schedule Trigger
The workflow automatically analyzes `main` and `develop` branches during scheduled runs.

### Branch-Specific Analysis
```bash
gh workflow run comprehensive-report.yml \
  -f branches="feature/new-module" \
  -f report_type="enhanced-dashboard"
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Compare health metrics across multiple branches
2. **Historical Trends**: Track project health over time with persistent data
3. **Real-time Data**: GitHub API integration provides up-to-date information
4. **Better Organization**: Structured deployment with branch-specific reports
5. **Enhanced Visualization**: Mobile-responsive dashboard with interactive charts
6. **Automated Documentation**: Self-documenting workflow with detailed summaries

## Next Steps

1. Trigger the workflow to test the enhanced dashboard generation
2. Verify GitHub Pages deployment at `https://pages.github.com/{owner}/{repo}/reports/`
3. Review historical data collection and trend analysis
4. Monitor performance with multi-branch analysis

## Technical Notes

- The workflow maintains backward compatibility with the legacy report generator
- Historical data is stored per branch to enable accurate trend analysis
- The enhanced dashboard supports both inline (single-file) and multi-file deployment
- GitHub API rate limits are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages
