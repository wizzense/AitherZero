# Comment-Triggered Releases

## Overview

You can now create releases directly from pull requests using simple comments! No need to manually push tags or run workflows.

## Quick Start

Simply comment on any pull request with:

```
/release v1.2.3
```

That's it! The system will automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Validate the version
2. üìù Update version files
3. üè∑Ô∏è Create and push the git tag
4. üöÄ Trigger release workflows
5. üê≥ Build Docker images
6. üì¶ Create GitHub Release

## Commands

### Stable Release
```
/release v1.2.3
```
or
```
@copilot release v1.2.3
```

### Pre-release
```
/release v1.2.3 --pre
```
or
```
/release v1.2.3 --prerelease
```

### Version Formats
All of these work:
- `/release v1.2.3` (recommended)
- `/release 1.2.3` (without 'v' prefix)
- `/release v1.2.3-beta.1` (with pre-release suffix)

## What Happens

### Step 1: Comment Detection
When you post a comment starting with `/release` or `@copilot release`, the workflow activates.

### Step 2: Version Validation
The system checks:
- ‚úÖ Version follows semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
- ‚úÖ Tag doesn't already exist
- ‚úÖ Version format is valid

### Step 3: Automatic Updates
The workflow:
- Updates `VERSION` file
- Updates `AitherZero.psd1` ModuleVersion
- Commits changes to the PR branch
- Creates annotated git tag
- Pushes tag to trigger releases

### Step 4: Release Automation
Two workflows automatically trigger:
- **release-automation.yml**: Creates GitHub Release with packages
- **docker-publish.yml**: Builds and publishes Docker images

### Step 5: Notifications
You'll receive a comment with:
- ‚úÖ Success confirmation
- üîó Links to workflow runs
- üîó Link to the release page
- üê≥ Docker pull command

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Release
```
/release v1.3.0
```

**Result:**
- VERSION updated to `1.3.0`
- Tag `v1.3.0` created
- GitHub Release created
- Docker images: `ghcr.io/wizzense/aitherzero:v1.3.0`, `:1.3`, `:1`, `:latest`

### Example 2: Pre-release
```
/release v1.4.0-beta.1 --pre
```

**Result:**
- VERSION updated to `1.4.0-beta.1`
- Tag `v1.4.0-beta.1` created
- GitHub Release marked as pre-release
- Docker images: `ghcr.io/wizzense/aitherzero:v1.4.0-beta.1`

### Example 3: Using @copilot
```
@copilot release v2.0.0
```

**Result:**
Same as `/release v2.0.0` - both syntaxes work!

## Workflow Integration

### Workflow: comment-release.yml

**Triggers:**
- Pull request comments containing `/release` or `@copilot release`

**Permissions Required:**
- `contents: write` - For creating tags and updating files
- `pull-requests: write` - For posting comments
- `issues: write` - For reacting to comments

**Jobs:**
1. **check-release-command**: Parses comment and validates format
2. **trigger-release**: Creates tag and triggers release workflows
3. **show-usage**: Shows help if command format is wrong

### Integration with Existing Workflows

The comment-triggered release seamlessly integrates with:
- `release-automation.yml` - Triggered by the created tag
- `docker-publish.yml` - Triggered by the created tag
- All existing pre-release validation and packaging

## Error Handling

### Invalid Version Format
```
/release invalid
```
**Error:** "Invalid version format: invalid"
**Solution:** Use semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)

### Tag Already Exists
```
/release v1.0.0
```
**Error:** "Tag v1.0.0 already exists"
**Solution:** Use a new version number

### No Version Specified
```
/release
```
**Response:** Usage instructions posted as comment

## Security

### Who Can Trigger Releases?

- Only users with write access to the repository
- Comments on pull requests from forks require approval
- GitHub Actions permission model enforces security

### What's Protected?

- ‚úÖ Version validation prevents invalid versions
- ‚úÖ Duplicate tag check prevents overwrites
- ‚úÖ Git configuration uses bot account
- ‚úÖ Token permissions are scoped appropriately

## Monitoring

### Watch Release Progress

After triggering a release, monitor:

1. **Workflow Runs:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Look for "Comment-Triggered Release"
   - Check "Release Automation"
   - Check "Docker Publishing"

2. **Release Page:**
   - Navigate to Releases
   - Find your version
   - Download artifacts or pull Docker images

3. **PR Comments:**
   - Success/failure notification posted automatically
   - Links provided to relevant resources

## Troubleshooting

### Release Didn't Trigger

**Check:**
1. Is the comment on a pull request (not an issue)?
2. Does the comment start with `/release` or `@copilot release`?
3. Is the version format correct (X.Y.Z)?

### Version Not Updated

**Check:**
1. Does the PR branch have conflicts?
2. Are the VERSION and AitherZero.psd1 files present?
3. Check workflow logs for specific errors

### Tag Created But Release Failed

**Solution:**
- The tag exists, so release workflows should have triggered
- Check the release-automation.yml workflow logs
- If validation failed, the pre-release checks may have issues

## Comparison: Manual vs Comment-Triggered

### Manual Process (Old Way)
```bash
# 1. Update version files manually
vim VERSION
vim AitherZero.psd1

# 2. Commit changes
git add VERSION AitherZero.psd1
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v1.2.3"
git push

# 3. Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3

# 4. Wait for workflows
# 5. Monitor multiple places
```

**Time:** ~5-10 minutes  
**Steps:** 5-7 commands  
**Complexity:** Medium

### Comment-Triggered (New Way)
```
/release v1.2.3
```

**Time:** ~30 seconds  
**Steps:** 1 comment  
**Complexity:** Low

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Faster:** One comment vs multiple commands  
‚úÖ **Simpler:** No git expertise required  
‚úÖ **Safer:** Validation prevents mistakes  
‚úÖ **Transparent:** All actions logged and commented  
‚úÖ **Integrated:** Works with existing PR workflow  
‚úÖ **Flexible:** Supports both stable and pre-releases

## Best Practices

### Before Triggering Release

1. ‚úÖ Ensure PR is approved and ready to merge
2. ‚úÖ All CI checks are passing
3. ‚úÖ Documentation is updated
4. ‚úÖ CHANGELOG is ready (or will be auto-generated)
5. ‚úÖ Version number follows semantic versioning

### After Triggering Release

1. üëÄ Monitor the comment for confirmation
2. üîç Check workflow runs complete successfully
3. ‚úÖ Verify release appears on Releases page
4. üê≥ Test Docker image: `docker pull ghcr.io/wizzense/aitherzero:vX.Y.Z`
5. üìù Optionally update release notes on GitHub

### Versioning Guidelines

- **Patch (X.Y.Z):** Bug fixes, no new features
- **Minor (X.Y.0):** New features, backward compatible
- **Major (X.0.0):** Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **Pre-release:** Use `-beta.N`, `-rc.N`, `-alpha.N` suffixes

## FAQ

**Q: Can I trigger releases from any branch?**  
A: No, only from pull request comments. The tag is created on the PR's branch.

**Q: What if I make a typo in the version?**  
A: The workflow validates the version. If invalid, you'll get an error comment with instructions.

**Q: Can I cancel a release?**  
A: Once the tag is pushed, the release workflows trigger. You'd need to delete the tag and release manually if needed.

**Q: Does this work with forks?**  
A: Comments from fork PRs require approval from maintainers with write access.

**Q: Can I see a history of comment-triggered releases?**  
A: Yes, check the Actions tab for "Comment-Triggered Release" workflow runs.

**Q: Is this secure?**  
A: Yes, GitHub's permission model ensures only authorized users can trigger releases.
