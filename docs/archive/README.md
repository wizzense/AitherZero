## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About This Archive

### Why Archive?

Documentation is archived when:
- The feature/work has been completed and integrated
- The content is superseded by newer documentation
- The information is historical but may be useful for reference
- The document describes a one-time fix or implementation

### What's Not Archived?

Active documentation remains in the main docs directory:
- Current guides and tutorials
- Active architectural documentation
- Current strategic planning (see [docs/strategic/](../strategic/))
- Maintained troubleshooting guides

## üîç Finding Information

### Looking for Current Documentation?
See the main [docs README](../README.md) for active documentation.

### Need Strategic Planning?
See [docs/strategic/](../strategic/) for current strategic documents.

### Looking for Historical Context?
This archive provides context for:
- How features were implemented
- Why certain decisions were made
- Evolution of the codebase
- Past challenges and solutions

## üìù Archive Policy

Documents are archived when they meet these criteria:
1. **Work is complete** - The described work is finished and merged
2. **Superseded** - Newer documentation covers the same content
3. **Historical value** - May be useful for understanding project evolution
4. **No longer maintained** - Content is not actively updated

Documents are **never deleted** - they're moved here for historical reference.

## üîÑ Using Archived Documents

When referencing archived documents:
- ‚úÖ Use for historical context
- ‚úÖ Reference for understanding past decisions
- ‚úÖ Learn from past implementation approaches
- ‚ùå Don't use for current development guidance
- ‚ùå Don't expect content to be up-to-date
- ‚ùå Don't rely on archived procedures

For current guidance, always refer to the main documentation in [docs/](../README.md).
