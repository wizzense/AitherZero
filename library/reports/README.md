### Persisted Reports (Committed to Git)
The following reports are **automatically updated** by CI/CD workflows and committed back to the repository:

1. **Dashboard Files** (`dashboard.html`, `dashboard.md`, `dashboard.json`)
   - Updated by: `publish-test-reports.yml` workflow
   - Frequency: On push to main/develop branches
   - Purpose: Quick access to project health metrics

2. **PSScriptAnalyzer Results** (`psscriptanalyzer-fast-results.json`)
   - Updated by: `quality-validation-v2.yml` workflow
   - Frequency: On every PR and push
   - Purpose: Track code quality trends

3. **Metrics History** (`metrics-history/snapshot-*.json`)
   - Updated by: `0512_Generate-Dashboard.ps1` script
   - Frequency: Every dashboard generation
   - Purpose: Historical data for trend analysis

### Ephemeral Reports (Artifacts Only)

   ```

2. **Manually trigger report generation:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run publish-test-reports.yml
   ```

### Old Reports Still Showing?

Old test reports (TestReport-*.json from specific dates) are ephemeral and should not be committed. They are automatically cleaned up in `.gitignore`.
